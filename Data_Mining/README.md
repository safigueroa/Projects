**Data Mining for Mental Health Awareness**

**CIS 4321 Spring 2020**

**Overview**

Mental health awareness will help us as a society to help those who are in need and increase the chance for early intervention. Mental health problems affect many of us through our loved ones or even ourselves – it is important to remove the stigma that is often associated with these concerns. Only then can we assist those who have severe impairment in social and school functioning from serious mental health problems, those who are too afraid to speak out.

**Dataset Description**

This dataset contains signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different socio-economic factors. There are 2321 unique values with 12 variables. These variables include country, year, sex, age, suicides\_no, population, suicides/100k pop, country-year, hdi\_for\_year, gdp\_for\_year, gdp\_per\_capita, and generation. HDI is a common measurement of a country's development ranging from low human development (below 0.55) to very high human development (0.8-1.0).

**Implementation**

I anticipate quite a bit of data cleaning for pre-processing. Looking at the data, I can see some missing values, and if I were to run some analysis such as PCA I could possibly extract or eliminate some features. However, since there are few attributes, I do not anticipate a lot of pre-processing. Exploratory Data Analysis will help me understand relationships among attributes as well as identify any problems. In an effort to find the highest density of suicides as well as the correlation and importance of each factor to that number, I expect various EDA plot graphs and predictive modeling such as linear regression.

**Results**

The target of my analysis is to find which variables are of most importance to the number of suicides and bring awareness to these. A predictive model will also help anticipate any sudden increase of suicide in relation to these attributes – any organization that fights for mental health awareness will know what and where to look. I believe that my analysis can help destigmatize mental illness by targeting various socio-economic factors and their importance on suicide rates. By using years of data, we can all focus our attention on what we should be directing our very limited resources to and help prescribe this problem.

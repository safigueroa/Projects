trademark tokenomics decentralized autonomous organization dao technology roadmap rebel bots collection disclaimer executive summary welcome to the rebel bots universe rebel bots xoil wars is cross platform card battle game players will be able to play progress and earn in single player or multiplayer sci fi themed game taking place in outer space the game will require players to unite around extra terrestrial kingdoms build their army of fighting robots and compete with other players for the valuable xoil resource introduction our vision is to create leading game franchise within the blockchain games space by building the rebel bots brand with several gaming titles players will be able to use the characters they own in all the games within the rebel bots universe among our goals is to create true social games which enable players to join forces with other players play both casual and competitive gameplay vision use gameplay mechanics known to millions of players create simple ftue first time user experience for non nft players launch the game with the help of thousands of robot owners create sustainable play to earn economy build the rebel bots universe in which players can play their characters in multiple games strategy game design goals in the initial design process of the game weve marked these aspects as key to make our play to earn game successful skill based game in order for the game to be competitive and allow the true dedicated gamers to earn from playing it the game will have to be primarily skill based with almost zero randomness and little to no luck involved in the gameplay in addition we wanted players to compete in more than one kind of tournament allowing players which arent ranked at the very top to still have chance of winning tournament we prioritize skill over payto win social gameplay the success of social games comes from the need to both socialize with other players but also from the joy of working together to win and complete achievements social gaming creates better virality improved retention higher engagement rates and most importantly organic growth high production quality the main reason users are currently attracted to the play to earn niche is due to the possibility of earning income revenue while playing game we want them to feel good about the game itself regardless of earning money this is why we are designing every aspect in the game from art design through to the backstory of characters and ensuring game stability and smooth experience so we can deliver the highest production level possible for players simple yet sustainable play to earn model generating revenue from playing the game is important but creating simple mechanism for players who prefer to engage with the game on different level and still earn from it is equally important for building user base of non playing users from the broader crypto community the long term token value will come from introducing new features which will drive the rebel bots game universe forward must be fun there is tendency to see play to earn games as job rather than an actual game we intend to change that by combining proven fun driven features from the social games space backstory and lore the year is its three years after the big dismantle event which saw millions of robots being scraped to pieces and their core destroyed by the humans who feared robots were about to revolt against them only were lucky enough to escape this fate in order to survive they formed the robot resistance which has only one goal to rebuild the robot factory so they can manufacture their brothers and sisters again the resistance is the robots last remaining hope after many attempts to make their plan work the robots were backed into corner they had no other choice but to flee earth to an unknown fate in outer space they have travelled space for years and due to low supply of oil they had no other choice but to land on deserted planet named xoilium which is unique planet with different habitats but with no known population and naturally no industrial capabilities or oil life in xoilium became harder searches for oil proved successful as the robots found small amounts of xoil extra terrestrial oil but the supply was scarce and the robots discovered there are other native inhabitants living in xoilium who also harvest the xoil for their own needs resources become scarce and so the rebel bots eventually turn against each other by closing themselves in isolated kingdoms declare war against each other and must battle for every drop of xoil read the full rebel bots backstory here to find out how the resistance was formed and what drove them looking for new home on xoilium https rebel bots medium com kingdoms the rebel bots game consists of thousands of different kingdoms each kingdom was built by one of the original generation rebel bots and its lands are protected by their powers like the rebel bots not all kingdoms are equal robots with rarer traits were able to capture themselves larger kingdoms with bigger lands in order to continue protecting their kingdoms the rebel bots divided their lands into smaller lands equal in size these lands are offered to players who are willing to protect their lords kingdom in exchange for the grant to pump xoil of the kingdoms soil use special kingdom powers and compete for the kingdoms treasure every season kingdoms the kingdom lords are the generation genesis rebel bots from the rebel bots collection this is the most valuable nft in the game as each rebel bot is kingdom lord the game will start with different kingdoms and kingdom lords the kingdom lord is not playable character the rebel bot avatar will be used as the kingdoms banner and every player who will join the game will fight under certain kingdom banner the precious land resource will be allocated to each kingdom according to the rarity rank of the rebel bot ruling the kingdom the rebel bots owners will receive revenue share from every land sold in their kingdom both in the initial land sale and in any secondary sale revenue share percentage is also determined by the rarity rank of the rebel bot as can be seen in the table below kingdom lords rb rarity min rb rarity max no of landsin kingdom total lands in tier revenue share kingdoms kingdom lords are able to generate additional income from royalties received from the kingdom players aka land owners as they use their kingdom land to produce xoil of every xoil produced in adventure mode players will share royalty to their kingdom lord and royalty to the kingdoms treasury treasury will be used as prize pool for the kingdoms top ranked players at the end of every season it is up to the kingdom lord to lead his kingdom to victories against other kingdoms by voting each month on the kingdom card incentivizing his kingdom players and more if the kingdom lord fails to perform the actions required from him as the ruler of the kingdom his royalties from the specific month will be transferred to the kingdoms treasury in addition to the kingdoms treasury the game will allocate additional prizes to kingdoms which have the most engaged players within the games social media channels kingdoms lands are the games second most valuable nft without land players arent able to play lands are initially sold directly to players on the games website while secondary land sales will be done on the games internal marketplace each land is located in different habitat and has various buildings headquarters communicate with other kingdom players fighting bots barracks train your fighting bot team fighting bots factory build new fighting bot and store parts xoil silo purify and store xoil spark capacitor store spark parts shop buy and trade parts intel command get updates about the game game will be launched with lands which will be allocated as follows lands will be sold to players during the game big land sale lands will be given to each rebel bot owner in his own kingdom lands will be used for marketing purposes prior to game launch each land will be sold or given with set of fighting bots allowing players to start battling from their first session in the game and thus offering simple onboarding process kingdom lands kingdoms after all lands were sold the game will issue new generation rebel bots generation rebel bots will be issued together with lands associated to them to allow more players to enter the game once new generation of rebel bots is created the former generation land capacity will be doubled as can be seen in this table below players can own multiple lands but can only play in one land at any given time if player chooses he can rent these lands he is not playing in for new players who want to enter the game at lower cost lands generation generation generation generation total lands in game new lands new lands new lands new lands new lands kingdoms every player in the game is part of kingdom players can choose to which kingdom they would like to join by acquiring land in that specific kingdom players can participate in all game modes tournaments and events in order to start playing players will need to build their initial fighting robot army the minimum amount for entering battles both adventure and pvp is fighting robots the amount of fighting bots player holds in his base will determine the amount of energy he has as can be seen in the table below kingdom players robots owned min robots owned max max energy energy allows players to play in reward based pvp battles and is recharged to the maximum level on daily basis the game is built to allow both competitive and casual players to earn from playing fighting bots this is the rd and most common nft in the game unlike rebel bots and lands the fighting bots have is not capped at certain number building and minting fighting bots is one of the ways to earn from playing the game players will need to build and assemble balanced team of fighting bots in order to succeed in battles and progress in the game battles are held between sides each has fighting bots these robots are used by kingdom players to win battles gain game resources and increase the players mmr matchmaking rating each fighting bot is made from different parts head torso left arm right arm legs each part represents different card and ability for the player to use in the battlefield the head is the most important part as it will also determine the fighting bot robot class parts have different rarity that will determine the strength of the card in the battlefield and its cost once built players will not be able to change the robot parts fighting bots the fighting robots can be built in different classes and class is determined by the robot head building pure fight robot meaning that all parts are from the same class this will grant the fighting robot improved abilities each class has sub classes military bots offense units high dps industrial bots defense units can absorb more damage engineer bots support unit repairs and increases stats of other units the classes have rock paper scissors relationship in combat providing bonuses and handicaps relative to each other each fighting bot will have constant parameter and one dynamic parameter hit points constant speed constant morale dynamic classes and stats fighting bots morale varies between and is determined by the amount of wins in arow player has and can increase both other parameters of all of the players fighting bots in addition each fighting bot will have special skill installed in it when built skills are stat or card effect modifiers fighting bots can be either bought on the marketplace or built using the game resources building large enough army of fighting bots will increase the players ability to store more resources as can be seen in the table robots owned min robots owned max max spark max parts max xoil more classes will be introduced to the game on regular basis fighting bots battles are done with cards each player enters the battle with robots when each represents cards in battles each card amount is doubled making deck of cards per each player cards are presented in the game by the fighting bot parts and have the following parameter in them class rarity battery cost damage armor special ability if card is rare cards and rarity choosing the right combination of cards when forming the fighting bots crew is crucial for winning battles the class of the robot will add bonus to the same class specific cards and having pure fighting bot will increase the abilities as well rare cards offer higher damage more armor and special ability cards have different rarities common rare epic legendary every season new cards will be added to the game fighting bots building fighting bots is the most exciting part of the game players will get to use the resources they earn from battles to build their perfect combination of fighters the fighting bots players are minted on the blockchain and become an asset they hold fighting bots manufacturing takes time and at any given time only one new robot can be built in the factory in order to build fighting robot players will need the following resources different parts head torso left and right arms and legs spark xoil rbls coin building fighting bots fighting bots the amount of resources each bot costs to build changes according to the amount of bots the factory has built during season the cost will reset once new season has started allowing players to mint more fighting bots for less resources gathering parts and spark will require players to participate in pvp battles while earning xoil can be done both in pvp and adventure modes getting parts in battle works in unique way players will be able to earn part which robot on the losing opponent team has making the battles more exciting each part has card attached to it and therefore players will know what ability to expect when building their fighting robot however rarity together with the special fighting bot ability are determined randomly after the building process is completed gameplay the goal of the game is to create fun and fast skill based game it will be the type of game which takes minutes to learn and lifetime to master players will be able to play it both in single player mode adventure and in multiplayer mode pvp the core gameplay is turn based semi automatic card battle it is based on the successful gameplay mechanics created by games such as hearthstone magic the gathering built for the more hardcore players and games such as clash royale built for the casual mobile gamers like the above mentioned games the rebel bots game will also be conducted between two sides each with their own cards and abilities battling to destroy the other sides characters by choosing which cards to play and how to play them in order to achieve the upper hand in the battlefield not all cards are equal some cards are more rare than others and therefore more powerful however they will require the player to exhaust more energy to use them in addition to the cards in their hand players will also be granted special ability he can use in battles that comes from the kingdom he she is situated in apart from the battles players will invest their time collecting and building the best and most balanced decks of cards which will give them the edge in battles creating the right deck of cards will require players to spend time learning the different abilities and types of cards gameplay the adventure mode is the single player mode in the rebel bots game players will be able to progress in this mode between various levels each level will reward players with xoil if they complete it in the adventure mode players travel between various habitats on xoilium with the goal to complete missions and clear locations of hostile aliens which drink the xoil from the planets soil only to use it later for malicious attacks against bases playing the adventure mode doesnt cost any energy to play however there is limit to the amount of xoil players can earn per day by playing the adventure mode the amount of xoil in each mission varies and divided into different amounts players will need to complete the mission times to gather the full amount of xoil every mission will have different difficulty level in the adventure mode from every xoil players earn portion will be given to the kingdom lord and another portion will be added to the kingdom treasury in the beginning of every season the missions will be changed and players will be able to continue playing the maps and earn more xoil adventure mode pve gameplay the player vs player mode pvp is multiplayer game mode allowing players to battle their fighting bot team against other players teams pvp is also the main way for players to earn xoil spark and collect parts players are matched together based on their mmr players with similar mmr will be matched against one another and the result of the battle will determine the amount of mmr each player will gain or lose in addition the higher the mmr difference between the players playing pvp costs one energy per battle when the player has no energy left he can still continue to play the pvp mode however he will only be able to gain mmr and not the other resources the xoil and spark rewards from winning pvp battles are based on the mmr and league player is in while the chance of getting new part is random multiplayer mode pvp mmr matchmaking rating the players match rating is represented in the game by trophies each player is represented in the game by the amount of mmr he has this determines his rank in the game leaderboards mmr is won or lost depending on the outcome of pvp battles the rank of the opposing player will determine the amount of mmr added or subtracted every new season players will start from the initial mmr of the league they have played in when the season ended and theyll need to work their way up to the top of the leaderboards gameplay leagues league min mmr max mmr league league league

players progress gameplay the gameplay is semi automatic card battle game players will choose which cards theyd like their robots to play and the robots will perform the card action in their turn this will go on until one side is victorious gameplay mechanics location battles take place in one of the players original kingdom habitats the kingdom habitat will show in the background of the battlefield kingdom card each player will start the match with kingdom card which was chosen by his kingdom players for the duration of the season the kingdom card can only be played once per match kingdom cards work exactly like other cards as they cost battery to use and can cause damage increase armor and hit points of fighting bots or use special ability on the battlefield gameplay battle flow each battle will start with showing each players robots and place them in their battle formation after that the following game phases will begin preview showing each cards of each players card deck while keeping cards hidden rounds limited time phase in which each player can choose which cards or special abilities to play outcome end of battle and determination of winner with the prizes

every single day people all around the world attempt to escape the mundane tonality of the real world through different outlets like gaming movies or anime with new applications powered by blockchain and web we now have the power to redefine reality into our own fantasies and live in ways that had only seemed possible in our imaginations imagine honing your combat skills to become brave and courageous warrior or gaining notoriety from discovering new lands and treasures to sell to the highest bidder begin mastering the ancient secrets of the lands to become spell casting mage or forging the finest weapons and armor to become known throughout the metaverse now imagine earning monetary compensation in exchange for the goods and or services you provide all of this and more will be possible in the metaverse created by mnnt ltd with our inspirations deeply rooted in anime star wars and steampunk cultures mnnt ltd envisions metaverse straight out of your favorite anime series fantasy world of wonder where the possibilities are bound only by our own imaginations within this fantasy anime world mnnt ltd ambitiously reimagines the way users interact digitally with one another facilitating paradigm shift from the increasingly curated and exhaustive experience that comes with navigating the various web social media platforms to an immersive digital experience where users interact creating relationships while also benefiting economically transforming the way we play earn and live in this nascent industry imagination is the only limitation to what can be achieved within our digital world of endless possibility andrometa metavers user owned and operated digital economy andrometa is virtual world mmo rpg developed on unreal engine made up of culmination of different planets geographical environments and cities that enables users to own build create and monetize their digital experience on our custom malaia sidechain using andrometa shrds our platform utility token andrometa offers unique experience to our users by giving them the ability to purchase tokenized land plots that owners can repurpose and monetize to earn shrds from their digital efforts the land plots are represented by non fungible tokens that can be bought sold traded rented etc expansive mmorpg environmental game play will come out in phases as more and more regions of andrometa are developed and released mnnt is developing true player owned and operated economy where players may earn not only by exploration and game play but also through content creation and adding value into the metaverse this type of business model empowers the creativity of our users as andrometa will continue to grow as more user generated content is created mnnt ltd envisions brand new and unique digital experience where users have the ability to become hunters gatherers forge masters tavern owners farmers merchants messengers warriors guild owners monster hunter and so on all the while earning real economic value from their inter metaverse professional pursuits completely separate from the real world economy brand opportunities dawn of the digital fashion era the commercial applications of the metaverse have been strengthened by new societal behaviors surging around buying products and services directly from social experiences known as social commerce social commerce is becoming larger percentage of commerce over time and was projected to be billion in alone similar to china utilizing the metaverse to create virtual showrooms fashion shows or dressing rooms brands can capitalize on the intersection of metaverse technology and social commerce to reach new consumers without traditional global restrictions brands designers and artists will have the ability to create entirely new and imaginative wearable lines or decorative assets in the form of nfts bought and sold free of gas on our malaia sidechain these nft items wearables can be purchased and equipped by users within andrometa ushering in future where brands and designers can release countless new lines of digital asset wearables without worrying about the logistics of overhead costs shipping storage sourcing of materials etc andrometa offers totally new experience as nfts continue to immerse individuals in the digital world as more people adopt nft technology digital goods will become its own asset class distinguishing itself as the digital services industry has over the last decade we are at the precipice of new digital age where digital interaction will begin to rival in person interaction future where people can choose to be represented publicly by their nfts we see this already with countless celebrities representing their social media accounts with nft pfps brands buying digital land in the metaverse and individuals making complete brands out of the nfts they own major retailers such as nike mcdonalds victoria secret gucci adidas and more have already began exploring digita related patents in preparation for this metaverse paradigm swiftly approaching mnnt ltd recognizes these trends and we believe they will only accelerate as time goes on and the technology behind digital immersion and the web revolution continues to improve play to earn three separate play to earn games imagine becoming the biggest employer supplying countless jobs in various countries all over the world without actually having any real employees that is what the future of work may look like with the emergence of the play to earn game model until now earning real income through gaming has been explicitly limited unless someone was popular streamer with the capability of securing sponsorship deals running ads on stream or winning big money tournaments your ability to earn through gaming was next to naught nfts are quickly transforming the world and gamified metaverse applications are leading the way in this nascent industry the traditional gaming models have continued to exploit gamers through free to play games where every day players spend time and money to buy items in game but receive no value added for their time or contributions in game for instance if player stops playing game all the money and time spent on items upgrading their players or maxing out their skills in game become worthless if the game is shut down for any reason such as decline in popularity that makes it less profitable all the players in game purchases vanish as if they never existed and all the players are effectively stripped of all the value they contributed up until this point this traditional single profit gaming model is outdated years of development have contributed to the relatively fixed gameplay in the game industry where most games are purely virtual and companies cannot combine the information content in the game with real life which makes the game and real life in relatively separated state this has resulted in monotonous profit model where companies only make profits by selling the content of the game itself game itself dlc game internal props etc and cannot expand more profit channels mnnt ltd reimagines this through the idea of play to earn gaming using the power of blockchain technology mnnt ltd will empower its users making the terms play and earn synonymous with one another within our play to earn games players can earn by completing missions winning battles completing quests generating value add content loaning or renting out in game items offering goods or services to other users competing in tournaments defi applicaiton of andrometa shrds meta smash fighters battle it out in close combat the first of these three games to be released in is meta smash fighters full fighting style game where nft owners can battle their nfts against each other in hand to hand combat to earn economic rewards bragging rights and above all else glory through hybrid mix of and animated iterations users will battle against each other with special moves fighting combinations with eye catching artistic styles that stay true to the underlying anime inspirations inspired by games such as super smash bros that brings multitude of gaming universes together under one umbrella mnnt ltd aims to work collaboratively with other nft communities allowing those communities the ability to access this fighting game as well through the variant creation system discussed in later section this will allow nfts from one community to battle nfts in another community creating truly inclusive nft gaming experience nft enthusiasts gamers and holders alike will no longer need to argue over which community or nft is better as they can simply settle their disputes in the battle arena where to the victor goes the spoils shrds and community bragging rights meta royale survival of the fittest mnnt ltd second play to earn game to be released will be in the form of battle royale style game users will have to utilize their nfts skills in various environmental arenas to be the last one standing in this ultimate showdown of nfts more details to come in of meta conquerors prepare your troops our third game expected to release is strategy game that can be compared to games like fire emblem or into the breach but on multiplayer scale the nft owner will be able to fight each other on large grid with variety of different abilities giving them lot of room to outplay their opponents and earn rewards for their skill not only their time spent in game this strategy game requires team roster of nfts in order to play more details to come in of missions restricted to the we are the outkast genesis collection mechanics missions are strategic thought invoking basic strategy game that allows we are the outkast nft holders to immerse themselves into the lore of our anime universe outkast nfts can be deployed in max teams of on these missions of varying length in order to generate erc tokens known as shards shrds for the outkast nft owners as well as experience points that go toward leveling up the deployed outkast nfts each mission is designed to yield around shrds over the mission period the missions are broken up into different pools where the amount of outkast nfts deployed in the mission pool will impact the amount of shrds earned per deployed squad possible shrds to be earned equates to shrds earned per second these shrds earned per second are split amongst all outkast nfts deployed in that specific mission example if only outkast nft is deployed and participating in mission this outkast nft would earn that full shard however once other outkast nfts are deployed on this same mission the shard distribution is then split between them all in accordance with the power ratings of each deployed squad what is power power is the strength an individual outkast nft or squad of outkast nfts have going into mission power directly relates to the efficiency of the outkast nfts deployed within the mission to yield shards and experience points xp every mission comes with unique piece of lore allowing the participants to immerse themselves into the lore of the anime story while playing game as with anything in life certain individual outkast nfts are better suited for different missions based on the attached lore and their own characteristics and traits in other words outkast nfts that possess traits or characteristics that align with the coinciding mission lore will receive what is called mission power boost allowing them to earn better yield of shrds and xp for example if mission requires stealth individual outkast nfts that have tactical equipment would receive power boost or if instead the mission happened in the dead of night individual outkast nfts that have night vision goggles may receive power boost and so on this requires planning and strategy on the part of the nft owners since they must try to select the best line up of outkast nfts to deploy for that specific mission in order to maximize their shrds and xp yield received rarity of the trait also plays part with the amount of power boost an item can generate the more rare the trait or item comparatively speaking the greater the boost for example the corroded rifle is one of the most common weapons traits in the collection therefore the boost received from this item is minimal however rare item such as the fire weaver sword will receive much greater boost think traditional video game mechanics where legendary weapons are more powerful and have better stats than their common counterparts how is power calculated the mission lore will explain which traits and weaponry provide boosts for that specific mission now imagine team of outkast nfts are the first ones deployed to specific mission the team of outkast nfts have total power of based on their traits and characteristics making the total deployed power within the mission this deployed team now receives of the total power giving the team owner shards every second minutes later seconds this team has generated total of shrds at this point another outkast team is deployed in the same mission with power level of now the total deployed power within the mission is at the new squad deployed now earns shards per second of the yield generated in the mission pool and the first squad earns of the yield shards per second keep in mind that this example was just simple example split between two teams note real missions have many more participants and multiple teams of four so the calculations and strategy become much more intricate and earnings per squad wont be as high as they were in the simple example level up your nft nft collections released by mnnt ltd have unique utility not seen in the majority of projects the ability to level up the nft over time as is seen in video games and anime series throughout history leveling up your nfts will produce greater rarity access to better fusions the ability to wield rare or legendary weapons and yield the nft owner more shrds on missions nft owners can level up their nfts by accumulating experience points xp through using interacting within andrometa completing missions and playing the play to earn games this means the rarity of the mnnt ltd nft collections is always fluctuating as owners continue to earn xp by interacting with our platform and play to earn games fusion how does fusion work note please be aware the fusion will only be available until outkast nfts remain mechanic fusion is system that allows the owner of two outkast nfts to combine fuse two outkast nfts together in order to create brand new outkast nft mixing and matching the traits of the original two in the process one of the two outkast nfts used for fusion are burned making the collection deflationary over time the collection will continue to reduce in size until only outkast nfts remain the cost of fusion starts at shrds this allows the fuser to lock any five traits giving the fuser some control over the randomness of the fusion if fuser chooses to lock more than traits each additional trait will increase the cost of fusion by shrds this base price to fuse will increase as more outkast nfts are fused users can check the various fusion combinations using the fusion change generator on our website this allows users to preview their fusions prior to fusing all of the collections released by mnnt will have these fusion capabilities fusions provide gamified ownership sequence which enables users to select nfts they may not ordinarily buy to use for fusion purposes this allows our collections to remain deflationary naturally shocking the supply through this organically built in fusion utility trait combos outkast nfts can be fused together to create entirely new nfts additionally the traits seen within the we are the outkast nft collection can also be combined fused together to create entirely different and sometimes brand new rare traits and or items not available within the original collection your new trait will hence be incredibly rare until others discover the combo this includes traits that had low rarity score to begin with it is important to keep in mind that some of the rarer trait combo are locked behind level requirement as with any game often times player needs to have certain level of skill to wield certain armors and artifacts the same can be said for the outkast nfts level bonuses fusing two outkast nfts allows the new creation to reach new heights sooner than base outkast nfts during fusion instead of adding experience points together their levels are combined giving them major boost as discussed in the missions section higher level outkasts have more power which will normally yield more shrds lvl outkast nft xp lvl outkast nft xp lvl outkast nft xp not lvl outkast nft variant creation system the mnnt ltd nft collections provide robust utility for holders of these original collections by allowing holders the ability create variants of their nfts variant is essentially an authorized derivative nft made from the original mnnt ltd nft collections owners of the mnnt ltd collections will have the ability to create brand new nft variants from the mnnt ltd original collections holders can create these variants as many times as they wish albeit with increasing shrds cost the variant itself becomes brand new nft that holders can then choose to sell rent to others to join up however what you want to do with these additional nfts will be up to you variants can be used in the mnnt ltd play to earn games as well as to access the andrometa metaverse mmorpg however holders will not be able to create variant from variant the variant creation system enables wide array of opportunities and vastly expands the user base of the mnnt ltd games and andrometa metaverse further it adds value to the original mnnt ltd nft collections since holders can make as many variants as they want to lend sell or trade variant creation opportunities fostering new opportunities within andrometa andrometa offers completely unique digital experience to its users the variant creation system provides opportunities for artists and creatives all around the world users can purchase from mnnt ltd varianeticist variant geneticist licenses these licenses give their holders the power to create variants in exchange for shrds mnnt ltd aims to foster artistic creativity and allow artists to build their brands promote their works and make real income within our metaverse by creating these new variant artworks in exchange for shrds as andrometa and our user base grows more artists and creatives will be attracted to our metaverse so that they can begin earning shrds for their services and growing their reputations individually as artists amongst our users the better the artist the more users will hire them to create their variant nfts aligning with our economic value of user generated content consistently expanding the andrometa metaverse mnnt ltd will need to approve the variant creation as the artwork and style will need to fit in with the style of the andrometa and play to earn games themselves uniting nft communities together we all can make it through the last several years the nft space has grown exponentially truly hitting its stride in with an explosion of new and unique projects as nfts increase in popularity and use cases many artists project founders and communities compete for relevancy amongst the big names and hyped projects this is normally done through providing utility attached to ownership of the nft itself however not every artist is developer and surfing the many unsold projects on the secondary market illustrates the difficulty of distinguishing one project from another mnnt ltd recognizes this fierce competition among nft artists and communities alike in order to begin unifying the nft space mnnt ltd plans to selectively partner with various nft projects and communities to provide additional utility to their projects and ultimately their communities through these partnerships mnnt ltd will provide these communities and their respective nfts access to andrometa as well as to our play to earn games using the aforementioned variant creation system with this system mnnt ltd imagine truly unified nft space all within one metaverse andrometa the real and digital merch stores store for the real world and the metaverse mnnt ltd offers unique experience for its collection holders both within andrometa and in real life mnnt ltd gives its users unique experience by offering the ability to purchase real life merchandise customized with their own unique nfts this means that nft owners can purchase merchandise customized with their own nfts allowing them the opportunity to flaunt their nfts anywhere they go additionally mnnt ltd offers an exclusive merchandise store made specifically for your nfts within our games and metaverse mnnt ltd will be releasing merchandise store where holders can use shrds to purchase traits items and nft assets that can be applied to their nfts depending on what collections you hold these items can be used for fusion and the creation of legendary traits and weapons creating this store allows holders to completely customize their nfts any way they desire andrometa marketplace creates endless possibilities for different brands and designers to create entirely new collections within the digital space where designers can create real nft fashion assets that can be applied to nfts on the malaia chain when the nft itself is sold the digital clothing assets stay with the original holder unless those nfts are also included in the sale mnnt ltd imagines designer brands designing not only traditional merchandise such as jackets and sneakers for these nfts but also completely new collections such as designer armor series capes face masks and so on this opens new world of opportunities for brands to establish themselves within andrometa and expose their brands to new global client base creating entirely new fashion lines specifically designed to be bought and sold within the andrometa the possibilities are truly limited only by ones own imagination shrds shrds are an erc utility token that powers the inter metaverse economy within andrometa shrds have wide array of uses such as of mnnt ltd nft collectionstransfer of new nfts and variants into andrometavariant creationpurchase of new mnnt ltd nft collections land and digital assetsinteractions

interactive participation in outkast nft related mangas and animes there are multiple ways to earn shrds the most efficient way is to own an outkast nft and send them on mission the second way is to add liquidity to any of our pools on the malaia chain finally mnnt ltd will be hosting regular tournaments in our metaverse allowing the most elite and skillful players to battle it out and earn this premium currency tokenomics shrds are deflationary token that find their naming inspirations from the anime lore shrds will be distributed to holders of the we are the outkast nft collection through the mission mechanic as well as to anyone providing liquidity to any available pairing pools on the malaia side chain with max supply of tokens here is the current issuance shards spread among the team and released over years active shards in the development treasury released over years active awarded to mission participants over years active shards awarded to liquidity providers over years beginning shards saved for tournament and competitive gameplay any shrds used to purchase goods and services directly from the mnnt ltd fusion nft minting governance votes variants will get injected

split according to the formula total supply max supply if will be burnt and will go to the community wallet if will be burnt and will go to the community wallet mnnt ltd believe this balance of redistribution will allow the token to prosper in the long term thanks to its deflationary nature without cutting out the rewards given to the community shrds staking users will have the option to stake their shrds in farming pools to assist in the stabilization and overall strengthening of the inter metaverse economy within andrometa an economy made strong due to the efforts of users and players alike users that choose to stake their shrds in one of these pools for one year will be rewarded with additional shrds that can then be used and exchanged within andrometa and mnnt ltd nft marketplace as explained in the tokenomics section shrds per month will be distributed evenly among all holders that choose to help secure the network and strengthen the economy of andrometa this way mnnt ltd can combat whales buying up all shrds and controlling the inter metaverse economy within andrometa malaia chain mnnt ltd is currently in its final stages of development for its malaia chain custom built ethereum linked sidechain developed to enable mnnt ltd to scale its ideas and provide users with the best experience within andrometa and our play to earn games the malaia chain is sidechain based on the ethereum network as result this chain can run any smart contract compatible with the ethereum virtual machine evm it is currently using proof of authority poa consensus to validate the on chain transactions however mnnt ltd aims to migrate to proof of stake pos consensus as more people join the ecosystem the malaia chain is linked to the ethereum mainnet via bridge that enables users the ability to move ethereum usdc and shrds between both chains malaia chain will eventually allow erc transfers but it isn priority just yet as the tokens nfts wouldn have any use outside of the malaia chain the malaia chain enables the freedom of gas free marketplace where players can transact freely with the security and validation of the blockchain allowing free flowing transfer of digital assets as intended in player owned and operated blockchain gaming economy we are the outkast immersive anime series new immersive experience mnnt ltd is made up of four diehard anime sci fi and fantasy fans with decades worth of combined viewership the inspiration for the nft artwork comes from anime star wars and steam punk and the lore behind the andrometa metaverse is no different an expansive collection of stories from different worlds that will eventually overlap with each other creating one grandiose saga mnnt ltd is providing viewers with digital entertainment experience that is the first of its kind in history all mnnt ltd collections come with limited commercial intellectual property rights for nft owners viewers for the first time in history have the ability to own the actual characters they see and follow throughout the series owners of these nfts can then write certain aspects of an episode story by spending shards earned within andrometa equally as important having ownership over certain characters opens world of economic possibility to the owner of the nft through reselling merchandise turning that nft into their own online brand persona creating and selling variants etc the ability for viewers to interact and have ownership over the characters within the show with the anime series has never been done before allowing fans to have an even deeper connection to the characters that they know and love mnnt ltd will change the way we consume entertainment media utilizing blockchain enabled ownership of in show characters items and worlds future nft collections mnnt ltd is producing an anime series that features the diverse continent of kuier with andrometa land filled with multiple different nations species and animals future nft collections released by mnnt ltd will incorporate the different nations and species found within andrometa all the original collections current and future released by mnnt ltd can be used to create variants that can be bought and sold as was mentioned prior mnnt ltd envisions future where fans can own the commercial ip rights to their favorite characters within the anime series these future collections expand that possibility and allow users to truly interact and connect with this anime series on deeper and more meaningful level market research the crypto gaming industry had

              " 'preface we expect the volume of people participating in the metaverse and purchasing nfts to continue to rise rapidly over the coming years this will inevitably result in price out of many people interested in the perks and exclusives of the most exciting nft projects due to limited supply high demand and floor prices most cant afford we created the mothership dao and the gray boys to solve this problem gray boys nft acts as membership to the mothership dao the mothership dao acquires nfts voted on by its members through proposals and yields fractionalized ownership and utility benefits to all members for the acquired nfts most importantly though and the innovative piece of the mothership dao is weve developed the ability to pass on perks utility verifiability exclusive content access and more by proxy to all members of the dao for any nft of any nft project that the mothership dao acquires the goal of this is to give the mothership dao members access to all of the utility perks exclusives and more of fantastic nft projects that they otherwise would have been priced out of as well as fractionalized ownership of nfts held in the daos community vault initial mint gray boys will be eth each to mint the initial pre sale mint of the gray boys will start on november rd the public sale will start on november th all art will be revealed on december st there will be gray boys available to mint the reason we selected was to give as many people as possible access to the fractionalized and shared utility the dao yields to its members of all mint sales will be allocated to the dao for nft acquisition as voted on by dao members the remaining will be allocated to the community and engineering fund these funds will be used to ramp up the engineering team underneath the engineering leadership iamarkdev to aid in building out the core tech dapps and browser extension to streamline the management of dao governance proxy utility and perks of acquired nfts to dao members additionally the community and engineering fund will also be used to drive community growth visibility and awareness of the project as these types of proposals are presented to the dao by the team dao decentralized autonomous organization the dao is structured in such way that you are only required to own at least gray boy to be member members claim the utility benefits the dao will offer by the proxy system for the nfts the mothership dao holds in its community vault fractionalized ownership for held nfts will be determined by the number of gray boys you own more gray boys owned by your address mean greater fractionalized ownership each gray boy provides the same fixed amount of fractionalized ownership regardless of its rarity or traits the mothership dao utilizes fork of compound governance and is the main governing body of the gray boys and the motherships nfts as well as acquisition and liquidation decisions our implementation has been inspired by proven work done by the nouns dao project as starting point dao votes may be delegated but by default will be allocated to each gray boy nft holder address and transferred to new owner addresses upon sale regardless of the existing delegation gray boy nft dao vote gray boy nft fractionalized ownership of the daos nfts tokens etc liquidity and nft acquisition acquisition of nfts and liquidation shall be done through dao proposals acquired nfts yield complete proxied utility to all holders to the fullest extent possible nfts liquidated shall have funds returned to the dao for future acquisition and utilization as proposed by the dao how is proxying nft utility possible nearly every nft project relies on connecting wallet to verify nft ownership using browser extension like metamask coinbase wallet etc or requiring you generate message signature with wallet that owns an nft for the project herein lies where we propose the idea of hybrid read only often called watch only wallet managed by the dao allowing dao members to have the necessary read only and limited signature generation rights to the wallet that holds nfts the dao has selected to acquire all without ever exposing private key or ability to transfer or submit transactions with the wallet we intend to do this through extending the functionality of the open source metamask extension while being within the bounds of their license for the technical implementation we intend to do this through creating read only wallet implementation within forked version of metamask as well as creating signing service to proxy allowed signed messages through the community vault wallet the end result is the ability to verify ownership for any nft project and access holder perks for those projects and more as if those nfts were exclusively owned by you and as if they were in your local metamask wallet additionally all of this will be made open source and publicly viewable through git repositories well provide all code and implementations will be open to be fully reviewed by peers in the community prior to going live lastly this will be done in such way that it does not conflict with your existing metamask extension it will run entirely separate and be specific to verification for nfts the mothership dao holds secondary market royalties of all secondary market royalties will be deposited into the dao forever the remaining will be distributed to the engineering and community fund to further the projects growth and development how will fractionalized drops work inevitably nfts that the mothership dao holds will yield drops of some kind in the future for these drops the resulting tokens fungible and non fungible will be stored in the dao and ownership distributed through the same fractionalized ownership mechanism as all existing tokens in the collection utilization of these drops is up to the decision of the dao members through approved proposals how will discrepancies and governance be handled after initial mint the dao will ultimately have full control and decision over any discrepancies and project direction not outlined in the whitepaper dont know what half this means whats the tldr by owning at least gray boy nft you are member of the mothership dao decentralized organization that buys and sells nfts proposed by and voted on by dao members in order to give access to more benefits for all members you also own percentage of the nfts owned by the mothership dao so long as you own at least gray boy nft dao members have access to the fullest extent possible to the perks utility and benefits yielded by nfts held in the community vault this is possible through something called watch only wallet our own clever open source chrome extension and guarded signature delegation system that lets you prove ownership when attempting to connect to projects via metamask to prove ownership and access utility which will be possible by the proxy system this means that should an nft project that the mothership dao holds an nft for opens up an exclusive game content event etc and they require proof of ownership to access those perks all mothership dao members will be able to access those perks by proxied ownership of the associated nft held in the daos community vault all of this will be as simple and automated as connecting your wallet to dapp with metamask as most are used to now there will not be complex processes and the implementations of everything proposed for all dapps extensions etc',\n",

nfts play to earn increased interest and focus on the metaverse from facebook and other companies and world driven physically apart by pandemic all indicate clear trend towards the need for more comprehensive online platform than what currently exists defining the metaverse can be challenging as it can encompass anything we currently do online but in simulated digital environment taking advantage of the digital connectivity we have rapidly developed in the last century the metaverse will combine online experiences in fluid and connected way that more accurately reflects the human

world that will exist as space to host data and ideas within the blockchain while creating new opportunities for the creation and collection of nfts as form of self expression utility or real estate in the metaverse in addition it will act as hub for marketing entertainment socialization gaming and education the starl token launch was very unique compared to most other cryptocurrency projects there was no pre sale or announcement it was stealth launch released with zero notice making it completely fair and equal the project has no team or dev token allocations and no tokenomics such as taxes or reflections woof decentra deployed starl without notice burning the initial liquidity to assure this would always be project dedicated to the people that believe in its vision and community metaverses are relatively new concept and technology and there are very few currently that exist beyond the research phase none are fully developed and most are notably underdeveloped all of them are centralized and controlled by companies or projects with problematic consolidation of power the starl metaverse is currently the only truly decentralized metaverse project and it is seeking to merge the concept of the metaverse with cryptocurrency based economy it is based in space themed setting for an enhanced experience that taps into what makes humans unique drive and desire to explore learn and go beyond starl will be used as the medium of exchange within the metaverse it will be used to buy sell trade and modify in game assets in addition starl will be used as points of entry for

for example racing games on moons and extraterrestrial lands shooting games inside abandoned spaceships and bases spaceships to fly throughout the metaverse and other solar systems and complete missions space stations to be captured defended or used for supplies all types of games ranging from adventure action and education are planned to be included all games will be connected and

personal data from the users for advertising or to maximize profits for yearly reports starl simply wants people to have fun interact with each other freely have access to opportunities that lead to financial freedom and work towards the next stage in the evolution of the internet and online interaction we have seen poor outcomes when projects are developed in greedy unsustainable or deceptive ways we want to create something that rises above all these methods starl will be empowering transparent fun healthy and fair starl believes strongly in decentralization holding this value at the core

whitepaper starlproject the concept of play to earn is quickly growing in popularity this is significantly enhanced in places where finding access to paid work may be difficult or for people in challenging personal circumstances where opportunities are lacking while the play to earn mechanism is used in several gaming projects unfortunately many have also abused it we will ensure fair balanced and secure mechanisms in gameplay and travel in the metaverse to avoid this users will have abilities to play and earn various assets that are valuable in quests and to progress further in game these assets will be earned by playing and completing missions or battles while traveling between spaceships and hubs in the metaverse users can either use these assets to progress in missions and games or sell them to others for profit on the starl market assets earned can be common and valuable materials fuel tools or weapons or rare assets that are hard to find and highly sought after on the market we also aim to provide vibrant virtual economy with ways to earn and trade as we believe in community input we will steer the direction of the project according to what the community thinks are fair and balanced ways to trade and interact in the virtual world while also creating fun and adventure filled metaverse to explore we look up to the greats of in game economies such as our very own scott brown jumpgate and warp nexus which is currently being reconstructed for starl metaverse starl will learn from the work of projects like these and create virtual economy that replicates the real world where actions bring consequences causes create effects and what you do not only affects yourself but the world around you economyand play to earn whitepaper starlproject for example specific items and components might only be available to craft in particular locations in the metaverse you could find that demand for features and raw resources is higher at one base or space station while the demand for finished goods is higher at another both users and ai can generate missions to deliver the required products to appropriate locations other tasks may require users to extract minerals deliver miscellaneous goods and much more contributing to dynamic economic system based on primary supply and demand if missions are accepted but fail due to pirate activity or attack then subsequent tasks will be implemented to combat the pirates in those areas thus users will not only participate in the metaverse but they will have part in shaping affecting and responding to it starl

be sought after as valuable assets if there is high demand more artist rendered limited edition living modules may be considered however standard modules will also be available for everyone further into development while these subsequent living modules will not be limited edition one off designs they will still carry attributes and will be available for purchase to all travellers of the

              " 'galaxy fight club official galaxy fight club white paper last updated feb disclaimer information outlined in this white paper and on our website is constantly updated and adjusted to deliver the best gaming experience content on both platforms should not be taken as investment advice and does not constitute any offer or recommendation of any investment product we are building cross ip pvp game for the nft universe this would be the best way to describe what we are trying to do the galaxy fight club gfc is not just an avatar project it is real time pvp game to bring together all the other different nft collections onto one single platform this means you can log in with an nft you have already bought and battle with that character referencing matthew ball one of the core attributes of the metaverse is that it offers unprecedented interoperability of digital items assets in other words you can use your counter strike gun skin to decorate gun in fortnite offer unprecedented interoperability of data digital items assets content and so on across each of these experiences your counter strike gun skin for example could also be used to decorate gun in fortnite or be gifted to friend on through facebook similarly car designed for rocket league or even for porsches website could be brought over to work in roblox today the digital world basically acts as though it were mall where every store used its own currency required proprietary id cards had proprietary units of measurement for things like shoes or calories and different dress codes etc matthew ball yet the current state of the nft space feels very siloed there is still little collaboration between different collections and to our knowledge no platform where different ips from different collections can interact with each other we see this as challenge that is preventing the nft space from growing into something more and its problem that we want to solve with gfc but instead of creating new utility based collections we want to create and add utility for existing nft avatar collections like the cryptopunks and the bayc galaxy fight club mission galaxy fight club mission to to be the nintendo of web but instead of franchises coming together in closed loop we believe in the interoperability of digital items assets in truly open ecosystem where the players instead of the company own the ip we aim to create cross ip game platform for the nft universe where different ips from different collections can interact with each other in meaningful way the vision in the fictional metaverse of ready player one called oasis there are different planets known for different experiences and players hop between each planet with their avatars in the future we see galaxy fight club as the go to platform for pvp experiences player might login to the sandbox when they want to relax and build but come to galaxy fight club for fighting combat and excitement team over half

number of vcs and being selective about who we bring onboard all of our investors were selected not just because of their financial backing but more importantly the strategic value each of them bring to the project we look forward to working with our partners to build out our vision over the coming years we brought on these advisors to the project because of their deep expertise in the gaming

metaverse and defi space having invested in and advised over projects that have strong synergy with highstreet partners note not all partnerships are listed out on this page galaxy fight club mission is to break down the silos between different nft projects in the space as part of this mission galaxy fight club has already established number of partners with leading tier nft native projects like cyberkongz byopills as well as gamefi projects like illuvium galaxy fight club provides adds long term utility to these projects by giving them access to our platform while they help to make it easier for us to turn our vision of creating super smash bros for the nft universe into reality we can and will be including any avatar collection we chose to prioritize and all major avatar projects will be added into the game over time whether there is partnership or not as long as the nft rights belong to its owner instead of the collection by signing into the game and agreeing to terms of use the owner of these nfts will give galaxy fight club the rights to create derivative work the whole point of nfts is ownership and this means allowing the owner to decide what to do with it whether to play the game or not if user does not want to play or participate with their avatars they do not have to and we would never display your avatars in our game without your permission roadmap we completed our genesis galaxy fighter collection mint in august and the genesis gear collection mint in november these nfts can now be purchased on the opensea secondary market closed beta was released in november the team is now executing according to the following roadmap and marketing schedule below participation everyone can participate in galaxy fight club if player does not have access to any avatars they will be given default fighter with base stats and default base tier weapon if they have partnered projects avatar they can play with that if they have genesis galaxy fighter they can also play with that the only difference is that the loot rewards that you can earn from winning are different based on the avatar or weapon you play with see play to earn section for more details teams of the same collection will receive team bonus in combat stats the game is also designed to cater to multiple types of players if player does not enjoy taking part in the actual battles they can play the game as manager and focus on renting out their stable of fighters to others to fight for them with loot share or one can become crafter and focus on finding the best ingredients to forge into newer and stronger weapons for arbitrage opportunities there is no one way to play the game and these are all viable paths to play to earn free to play players players who don own any nfts can also play to earn inside our game players will be given default base character that they can battle with winning matches will allow them to win silver keys these silver keys could be sold directly on the marketplace as independent nfts for eth or you could keep them and open loot boxes with gcoin which gives you loot that could potentially be worth more than the keys themselves to earn more from the game there are few options you could purchase genesis galaxy fighter which generates between gcoins per day and allow you to win gold keys as well as participate in the tournaments you could purchase nd generation galaxy fighter which allows you to win gold keys and participate in the tournaments you could purchase weapon from the genesis gear collection which allows you to win gold keys regardless of which avatar you play with game modes mode requirements rewards anyone can play loot box keys tournaments galaxy fighters goin eth anyone can play not available battle royale anyone can play tbc main game mode this is the main mode of the game mode allows you to either enter as pre made team or get matched with others to play you can play in this mode whether you are playing as galaxy fighter or as an avatar from another collection or even if you are player with no avatar the only impact is the type of loot box keys you can get as rewards at the end of round tournaments team tournaments are in format and instead of finding teammates through online matchmaking you will only be able to enter tournament with pre made teams you can find team mates in our discord or find friends and family who might be interested to join you only galaxy fighters can enter into tournaments genesis or nd generation match is over when either team has points point kill the winning team will advance through the tournament until the final the team that wins the final will win the eth or gcoin prize which will be split three way among the team members this is the classic death match mode players will enter into the battle arena and the player who accumulate points kill point first will win the match there are no rewards to this mode battle royale classic battle royale mode where players join the same battle arena and the last man standing wins death ring will appear on the borders on the map to slowly shrink the area which fighters can fight in the rewards to the battle royale mode are to be determined mechanicsa real time nft pvp gamethe game will be hyper casual styled fighting game that is similar to brawl stars fighters will be able to engage in both melee or ranged attacks depending on the weapon that they have selected with movement system that allows them to move up move down left right as well as the ability to engage with several obstacles and objects scattered across the map two main factors determine the outcome of battle in equal measures the overall strength of your fighter is decided by their traits namely base race armor and weapon your gameplay performance we dont want this to be pay to win game where rarer fighter will destroy everyone else although rare fighter with strong armor and weapons provides significant advantage it is still only half the equation as the rest will depend on how well you can actually play the game it is entirely possible that more skilled player in the game with percentile fighter can beat percentile player battle arenas our game is set in the year and as such our first battle arena will be set in cyberpunk themed high rise rooftop there will be battle arenas of other themes to follow including one set in space one set in jungle and others the battle arenas will be scattered with health packs boosters hiding places and other obstacles statsthree factors determine the overall strength of your fighter race clothes armour weapon these three elements together make up the total strength of your fighter other traits in fighter can also add bonus points to their overall strength as an example fighters with laser eyes obviously increases their attack power and fighters wearing helmets obviously have increased defense matching armour pieces will also add bonus points for example plasma armour with plasma helmet as general rule the stats of race armour or weapon is closely related to their rarity which means rare race with rare weapon will almost always be stronger than one that is more common leveling ranking systems nft level every nft fighter will be assigned level based on the experience points accumulated by playing galaxy fight club experience points are unique to each nft fighter cannot be transferred to other nfts and cannot be lost increasing fighters level will increase their combat stats resulting in stronger fighters account rank every account wallet will be assigned rank based on the number of trophies accumulated by playing galaxy fight club trophies are gained or lost depending on in game victories and losses an accounts rank influences matchmaking and determines the likelihood of receiving loot boxes at the end of matches increasing your accounts rank will increases your chances of receiving loot boxes account ranking system ranking is system that sort players into different tiers based on the number of trophies they have accumulated trophies are awarded to players account when match is won and deducted from players account when match is lost trophies are assigned to an account wallet not an individual nft the purpose of ranking system is to ensure fair matchmaking by allowing players with similar skillsets to compete against one another determine eligibility and entry requirements for exclusive tournaments and reward successful players with more loot boxes an accounts rank directly impacts the drop rate of keys loot boxes when match is won the higher an accounts rank the more likely they will receive rewards when they win in game this reward mechanism will be modified to discourage anti competitive behaviour such as deliberately losing games to compete against easier lower ranked players and award those players who are victorious in the arena this mechanism also encourages play to earn players to play more often there are different ranks which are then categorised into different leagues nft leveling system levels are assigned to an individual nft fighter and impact an nfts in game strength levels are gained by earning experience points nft fighter will earn experience points by completing games with more points being awarded for victories experience points are not deducted for losses and therefore an nfts level will never decrease unlike ranks which fluctuate as trophies are lost when player is defeated leveling up nft fighter improves its combat strength stats increasing the likelihood of winning games the leveling system applies to nft fighters from the gfc universe as well as nft fighters from other projects and collections experience points are tied to each unique nft fighter when an nft is sold the nfts experience points and level will also be transferred to the new owner levels are tied to the nfts themselves to enable true play to earn mechanism players will be able to buy untrained fighters train them up and re sell them at higher value as the increase in the nfts level results in stronger more valuable fighter players can also level up using their base character although it isn an nft there is lower cap on the maximum level players can get to versus an nft character fighters userbase and monthly active users mau are important metrics that should be increasing over time for healthy game and our system is set up to achieve this goal while ensuring the value given to the original galaxy fighters also increases over time fighters form the basic block to our game and we aim to integrate as many of the pfp collections into our game as possible which allows an ever increasing userbase and our game modes is designed to optimise for this outcome see partners we will be working towards having unique in game character for every single unique nft in each collection for example there would be unique in game characters for bayc each in game character only unlockable with their corresponding nft the images above shows examples this is clearly very labour intensive process as it will require the creation of every unique trait in each collection which is why our initial game release will not have unique in game character for each nft but instead will have unique characters by race fur type as an example the following in game characters will be available for the bored apes collection in game character bayc brown ape bayc black ape bayc golden brown ape bayc cream ape bayc tan ape bayc pink ape bayc gray ape bayc blue ape bayc red ape bayc cheetah ape bayc white ape bayc zombie ape bayc robot ape bayc dmt ape bayc death bot ape bayc noise ape bayc trippy ape bayc solid gold ape the battle stats to the fighters will not be revealed and remain hidden for number of reasons first of all we believe part of the enjoyment is figuring out which fighter or which traits are stronger secondly we do not want this to turn into pay to win game finally it also allow for more fair cross collection battle if the galaxy fighter tokens have their stats visible but the other collection do not then it creates an imbalance of information between gfc token owners and partnering collection genesis galaxy fighters our very own collection genesis galaxy fighters are the original nfts we launched in august these are playable characters in our game alongside avatars

into galaxy fight club there is an original galaxy fighter collection these galaxy fighters come from different races the human race alone will have variants as general rule the rarer the race of the fighter is the stronger it will be in battle gold humans are the rarest but they are not necessarily the strongest on the power scale because they are considered human race variant instead of unique race many of the gold humans are very strong however due to the rarer armour that comes with them compared to the ones available for stronger races races humans beasts ogre alien reptar glopz death

weapons or armour companions link to gfc companion gfc companion companions were airdropped to certain holders which met specific requirements in august companions will have future utility in the game for example you will be able to bring them into the battle with you to deal extra damage to your opponents or help you absorb damage companions do not yield gcoins like the original galaxy fighters do training nd gen fighters training is gfc version of what many other projects called breeding it allows genesis galaxy fighter to create nd generation galaxy fighter the training process looks like this galaxy fighter weapons burned gcoin nd generation galaxy fighter there will be gcoin discount to the price of training in the first week from release the rarity of the nd generation galaxy fighter is determined by the weapons you use to train it and unlike forging you will be able to use combination of both ranged and melee weapons as training ingredients using higher tiers weapon and og weapons for training will significantly increase the chances of receiving rare nd generation you can use og weapon as an ingredient in any particular forge and it will have chance for your forged weapon to skip tier for example using og gloves to forge with other uncommon weapons will result in chance of skipping rare to an epic tier weapon the generation galaxy fighter used in the training process will also have an effect on the rarity of the gen fighter the stronger and more rare the gen fighter is the stronger and more rare his students will be nd generation fighters are special for the following reasons on average stronger than gen fighters ability to earn gold keys participate in the exclusive weekly tournaments of eth gcoin prize access to exclusive discord channelweapons weapons are scarce resource in the game and demand will always exceed supply weapons are key resource inside the game and is designed to always be in short demand it will be hard to come highly valuable resource which makes the progression to get the best weapon and most rare generation fighter long term one like galaxy fighters there are different tiers to them they are extremely important in the game loop for few reasons they make up of the strength of fighter each of the original galaxy fighter comes with their own weapon which can be used inside the game similar to the fighters themselves the strength of the weapon is correlated with their rarity and tier there will also be difference between melee and ranged weapons ranged weapons will have bigger reach shooting distance while melee weapon is limited to close quarters but generally deal greater damage if you want to swap out your weapon you will need swappable weapon which are unique nfts this means every single player in the future will likely want to switch or upgrade their weapon we believe dau of players in the medium to long term is realistic genesis fighters nd gen fighters fighters from partnered collections players season source amount tier description og airdrops uncommon rare special in game combos and increases nd generation rarity significantly genesis genesis gear loot box basic epic all weapons in this collection are exclusive and cannot be won in game this is the only collection of weapons for non gfc fighters that could be used to win gold keys season loot box opens with gold keys silver keys tbc tbc link to gfc genesis key which opens into genesis weapons gfc genesis key link to gfc genesis weapon gfc genesis weapon link to gfc weapon gfc weapon they are used in forging weapons are the raw ingredients to forge stronger weapons please read the forging sub section for more clarity of weapons gcoins burned next tier of weapon they are used to train nd generation fighter galaxy fighter weapons burned gcoin burned nd generation galaxy fighter please see the training sub section under fighters for more details forging forging refers to the process of combining number of weapons into higher tier and stronger weapon at the blacksmith unlike training which requires genesis galaxy fighter to take place forging does not require you to of weapons gcoins next tier of weapon our weapons contract will be using the erc to make the forging logic more simple it will allow players to forge number of lower tier weapons into higher tier weapon fully on chain using custom function player will have to take number of weapons also called materials ingredients to the blacksmith they will the need to pay fixed amount of gcoin and the blacksmith will then forge the lower tier weapons into higher tier weapon the specific weapon that comes out of the forge will be randomly generated however ranged weapons will always generate ranged weapon and melee weapons will forge into melee weapon the forge mechanic is designed to get rid of excess supply of low level weapons in the game while burning gcoin supply from the game economy it also offer way for progression for serious players by obtaining more and more powerful weapons ingredients tier of ingredients needed product basic common common uncommon uncommon rare rare epic epic legendary legendary mythic mythic exotic why we have forging system we have both weapon forging and breeding mechanism which we call training because helps create more long term sustainable game by enabling both vertical progression element of the game in addition to the horizontal progression training breeding this is lesson we have learned from other games for example axie model allow players to earn money by farming slp and the value of slp is driven by breeding axies which is driven by more players coming into the ecosystem the training part of our game is exactly like this you can train new galaxy fighters using gcoin and the new galaxy fighters allow you to win better loot and participate in the weekly tournaments the problem with game that only has training breeding mechanic is that it puts cap on their userbase and also leads to asset inflation of in game economy original fighters become weaker solution to this and one which axie infinity is implementing in early is actually allowing players to upgrade axies so demand for slp gcoin is not only driven by creating more quantity of fighters axies but also from improving the ',\n",

to express our unique personalities and stories through nfts and artwork we purchase we are not about fake likes posts and stories on instagram we have passion for what we do we are all incognito this collection consists of unique incognitos randomly combined from tens of thousands of different possibilities these nfts live on the ethereum blockchain as erc tokens the only way to fully go incognito is by purchasing your own nft thus becoming part of the incognito family all nfts will be available for purchase thereby expanding the opportunity to join our community as founders we believe in buying back the floor instead of reserving certain amount upfront weve also instructed our staff members not to mint any icons as we ll be purchasing them from the secondary market when creating the initial prototypes our main goal with the incognito collection was to elevate the design of our nfts we wanted our designs to have meaning which is why we endeavor to create nfts that hold real artistic value and quality that is unmatched in the community to accomplish this reality we set one simple goal create something astonishing that is guaranteed to be remembered we rather see them up on every collector wall instead of their twitter profiles ideally we would like both to happen nft art over three months of planning prototypes designing rendering and brainstorming went into the creation of the entire incognito collection nft artwork we strove for perfection wanting to create something visually unique and well executed our artwork is as important for us as our security community erc contract and every vital part of this project we are meticulous through every step of the design process nfts have typically been the norm in the nft space so far not many artists and collections are leveraging nft space especially when it comes to collections of our size we are eager to explore the possibilities of the space each nft will have downloadable content that can be accessed through our website providing collectors with access to files for printing rendering premade animations and full resolution image of your incognito we will continue to add even more utility content for each nft special rewards these are the special rewards that will be given out to the lucky incognito holders of each unique icon nft introduction significant feature of the incognito collection is the rewards we give out to fellow incognitos these rewards will range from numbered hoodies to art pieces such as paintings sculptures drawings and more our goal with these rewards is to give back to our community and help them understand how important they are to our movement our rewards are carefully chosen to bring elements of the digital and physical art world together we

australia to argentina and everywhere in between both individuals and third party companies came together to make the incognito vision reality we feel very confident in the combined expertise professionalism and passion of every member of our team technology the core of every nft collection is its technology this is why we decided to look for group of developers instead of one or two individuals common with other collections we teamed up with small company based in argentina called building ideas by software on the road team of six individuals was contracted to work on our smart contract the entire erc layout web development security implementation much more community team there is not an nft collection that successful without its community following for this we have brought

to create custom chain and pendant that will be given away to enter this giveaway you must own an incognito that has the icon chain attribute opportunity unique opportunity to be part of something special the problem the nft community has been pouring millions into projects that have no real foundation or team with the professional experience to guide multi million dollar project additionally and rather unfortunately other nft collections often involve very poor artistic value all of this means collection dies off in couple of days or weeks some people make money with quick flips but long term holders aren rewarded most nft collections have been lacking artistic value and quality many individuals are taking advantage of this community hype resulting in quick money schemes instead of real nft projects with long term vision we believe this community is forgetting what nfts should represent pouring money into things that have no future value we can and should do better as community in general opportunity there is an incredible opportunity in the nft community to create something that can be seen as an industry standard and change the way collections of this type are viewed by building both collection and team that focused on quality and real artistic value we are hoping to create brand that will be part of nft history the incognito collection is just the first of many different projects we have planned for the future of dyn studios nft ownership intellectual property consumer agreement this intellectual property consumer agreement hereinafter referred to as the agreement is made by and between dyn studios and the purchaser of an incognito icon from minter the purchaser or you or your this agreement becomes effective at the time you purchase an icon if you do

various different bases characteristics and attributes each an attribute which will be randomly combined to create each icon for example earings eyes hats neck body face mouth and material attributes and or the like no two icon will comprise the same combination of attributes the collection consists of randomly generated and unique icons living on the ethereum blockchain as erc tokens ownership

              " 'whitepaper november edition table of contents executive summary introduction monetary policy game economy development roadmap disclaimer goons of balatroon gob is universe powered by digital assets that engage and empower users through digital ownership and economic activity blockchain based trading card game is at the center of this universe where players battle with wacky and quirky cards the humorous nature of the cards is very much reflection of the loose and fun nature of the balatroon fantasy universe it is place that aims to offer an immersive in game environment that transcends gaming the game is built with unity and uses ethereum technology to allow players to own in game non fungible tokens nfts that are usable and functional within the gaming framework these digital assets give their owners the power to earn further rewards distributed by automated systems that hold real world value alternatively the assets can be sold in nft marketplaces all players can access the play to earn aspect of the game but owning and bringing into play digital identity in the form of goon nft guarantees superior gob token rewards executive summary and access to premium features goons are characters that roam the lands of balatroon and represent the primary digital asset layer they battle each other using non nft and nft based cards which serve as the second digital asset layer nft based cards are rarer more desirable and are essential to creating powerful decks gob token is the in game currency that fuels the game economy and serves as the platform utility players can earn gob by simply playing the game or leasing their goon nft to other players and sharing their game rewards additionally users may opt to stake their gob in the staking protocol and receive additional tokens as reward for stabilizing the economy users can choose to use gob or eth the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum blockchain to purchase card packs craft new nft cards in game purchase add ons and enter into lease agreements with goons nft holders to experience the gaming world more affordably however using gob as payment method will guarantee discounted price the above features are built on the ethereum blockchain while using immutable as layer solution immutable offers zero gas fees instant trades and scalability which are all important to creating seamless and accessible gaming experience zero gas fees instant trades scalability goons of balatroon is virtual world where players can own goon and use it to engage in strategic battles with carefully crafted deck of cards it is place where players can choose to join either the bulas or the bairs faction and find the goon that is right for them as they navigate through the challenges presented by the elements on the battlefield earn gob rewards for winning battles or stake the tokens for further rewards and have say in the future of the gob gaming world the game economy set up by gob will feature an autonomous rewards pool structure to enable individual transactions without oversight this paper will explore the conceptual underpinnings of the gob economic ecosystem and outline how the gob token will interact with the worlds services characters and items nfts the goal is for the reader to be introduced to the various defi mechanisms and methodologies used to bridge the nft layer through gob the token itself is designed for in game mechanics and thus the underlying fact is that gob gob always introduction the game uses ethereum technology to provide unique mechanics that allow players to be part of the game beyond the traditional and flawed playing models existing in the gaming industry players can have real ownership and full control of in game digital assets such as goon characters goon cards and items used for customization purposes player empowerment doesnt stop here as players can also take direct ownership of the game through revenue sharing model facilitated by token staking with an automated rewards system sustainable economic environment is created by flipping the power structure taking control away from the publishers and allowing players to drive and dictate the games direction this model promotes interaction and engagement and ultimately incentivizes users to participate actively in the gameplay and economy being part of the game digital assets such as goon characters goon cards and customization items are an essential and integral part of the game itself although such assets are not prerequisite to playing the game and being part of the community players can evolve and grow with the game using the nft enhancements that increase their engagement and advance their playing level integrating functional nfts into gameplay the gob universe is controlled by characters called goons owning goon differentiates the player during battles guarantees superior play to earn rewards and gives access to add ons such as goon bods goon characters goon bods the goon characters also known as goon avatars are only visually presented as headpiece players can exude their ideal style in the game by customizing the body of their avatar through second nft called goon bods each body enhancement also carries unique in game animation such as finishing move or dance the winning players character triggers the animation at the end of the battle goon cards all players get access to free base card pool that is not considered digital asset it allows players to play the game understand it and decide if they wish to enhance their card deck to be more competitive nft based goon cards are more desirable and powerful enhance battle strategies and add the important functional aspect of ownership into the gameplay the ownership of goon nfts unlocks full economic access to the game but there are alternatives for potential players to enter the game world more affordably new players can either lease goon nft or even play the game without any nfts for the latter user can launch the game and access pool of default free non nft playing cards they can now battle any player and become eligible to claim gob for in game upgrades or new cards although this free path to the game is there to be used the gob rewards earned from battles will be fraction of what goon nft owners generate an alternative is thus offered to players to lease goons from other players and in turn satisfy that requirement and earn the maximum token rewards these alternative access paths enable user growth while protecting goons nft holders benefits enabling user growth immutable imx is scaling solution that allows players to grow within the gob ecosystem by significantly decreasing transactional fees incurred during the buying and selling of nfts deploying gob assets onto imx ensures that it is affordable for any user to engage in digital transaction without worrying about high transactional costs associated with the ethereum scaling the system with immutable blockchain this move to gasless or free trade system will create higher activity levels for deck building and buying cards on the buying and selling markets user engagement is highly valuable to create sustainable ecosystem using this solution will create foundation through which high participation rates on the market can be created and bring more economic opportunities for new players and traders combined with speed and affordability this model solves layered solution for deployment at mass level to facilitate mass adoption of the gob ecosystem monetary policy the gob token is the governance and rewards token of the goons of balatroon universe eth is added to the ecosystem as another currency to acquire in game assets and pay for in game activities and other necessary game functions the value of gob will come from the sustainability and expansion of the game economy gob has fixed supply of tokens which will be allocated as follows liquidity private seed group play to earn rewards staking rewards ecosystem team public sale aloc gob aloc tge months linear vesting month cliff months linear vesting month cliff month linear vesting exponential decay unlock month linear vesting month linear vesting months cliff months linear vesting vesting period end of cliff quarterly for months end of cliff monthly for months daily emissions tge daily emissions end of cliff monthly for months tge monthly for months vesting terms the play to earn rewards pool is the key driver of the game economy and so is assigned the largest distribution allocation of tokens the gaming rewards attract players to join the ecosystem and incentivize them to play an active role by playing the game trading digital assets and participating in various gaming activities that support the economy rewards from the pool will be distributed to the players through regular daily rewards tournaments special events and missions these rewards are based on an autonomous system where the gob team has no control of the distribution of tokens play to earn rewards large part of the goons of balatroon metaverse is the community members nft owners game players fans investors and creators tokens are allocated to this pool to initiate facilitate and support community engagement to deepen and strengthen the relationship and trust between gob and the community the tokens will be used for community tournament rewards design contests referrals growth projects and increasing the governance and engagement of the community ecosystem tokens are allocated into two staking reward pools to be later distributed between the stakers of gob tokens and gob nfts tokens will be channeled into the staking pool that rewards gob stakers this initial pool contribution will kickstart the staking protocol rewards before the economy fully functions with self sustaining gamingrelated inflows the remaining tokens are put into the staking pool that rewards nft stakers nft stakers are defined as anyone who simply has not listed their digital assets on rd party marketplaces this allows goon owners to earn gob tokens on their nft before game release in both cases the distribution of tokens will be controlled through reward based exponential decay strategy that rewards early contributors with higher emission rate the distribution of tokens is done through an automated system without any influence from the gob team staking rewards pools tokens will be allocated to the gob team to support technical development executive management and partnerships the tokens will unlock over months after month cliff team tokens will be reserved to provide market liquidity to decentralized exchanges the tokens will be instantly released upon tge liquidity tokens will be reserved for private sale information regarding the allocation of tokens towards public and private sales will be available at future date gob token is not an investment vehicle and the gob team cannot make any promises regarding future value private sale tokens will be reserved for public sale information regarding the allocation of tokens towards public and private sales will be available at future date gob token is not an investment vehicle and the gob team cannot make any promises regarding future value public sale game economy goons battle is free to play game that provides an optional premium economic layer where players collect digital assets receive higher gaming rewards and access features that enhance the gaming experience the game economy is sustained through natural cash flows that include fees from gaming related activities as inflows and carefully balanced rewards from gaming and staking activities as outflows the game economy can be broken into five modules that work together to create circular and sustainable economy stakeholders base pools exchange inflow channels outflow channels the base pools contain tokens funded through either economic activities or monetary policy and are fundamental in supporting defi mechanisms base pools vault the vault is pool responsible for creating the buying pressure of the gob token and facilitating token rewards to stakers the pool receives eth through certain inflow channels an automated and parametric system then facilitates the purchase of gob tokens on the open market to replenish the tokens held by the staking pool while gob will control the vault and establish its structure at the start the system is built in way that enables future transition to fully decentralized economy where users vote on decisions that will shape the game going forward staking rewards pool game rewards pool gob gets accumulated in the staking pool from the vault and is then distributed among all stakers in the system using the staking protocol users will be able to visualize their stake and anticipated rewards in dynamic way the game rewards pool contains tokens that reward players for participating in battles unlike the vault and staking rewards pool tokens the two stakeholders in the gob ecosystem are the community and gob foundation all economic inflow activities originate from the community and all economic outflow activities move into the communitys hands gob foundation receives some of the inflow generated by the community as revenue streams as always gob equals gob stakeholders all eth that gets accumulated in the vault will eventually flow to the staking rewards pool however since the pool only distributes staking rewards in gob this requires eth to be first exchanged to gobs native token this process will ensure consistent buying pressure of the gob token and will be one of the main drivers of the tokens stability exchange the inflow channels are created from fee based economic transactions that provide value to the community the inflow of fees gets channeled to either the vault or the gob foundation fees sent to the vault eventually get distributed to stakers in the system as reward for contributing to the network in contrast fees sent to the foundation are used for technical and executive development and represent the revenue streams for the gob team inflow channels gob foundation inflows goon store goon character nft the goon store will offer the community new goon nft factions for sale in addition to the original bear and bull goon character nfts the new factions will come into play as the ecosystem and community grow the original two factions only feature characters so the number will be expanded as the game matures in this pool are assigned by the monetary policy gamers receive rewards according to their ranking and whether or not they own goon nft goon owners are eligible for the maximum rewards per battle while freemium gamers receive rewards at far smaller scale vault inflows goon store goon card packs goon card pack sales from the goon store are considered to be the primary vault inflow the packs are released in series and each contains nft based cards that can be common rare epic or legendary the nftbased cards help players increase their odds of winning battles by having special abilities that create strategically superior and robust deck crafting

              " 'suspicious monkey studios pxquest whitepaper public release intro what is pxquest what do we hope to achieve the plot in words adventurer nfts gameplay raiding dueling kingdom building summoning chronos what is chronos earning chronos smarter cheaper architecture having your cake and eating it too gasless raiding on chain meta randomisation fair and transparent sale intro what is pxquest pxquest is an nft dungeon crawler in which every character piece of loot and plot of land are erc tokens owned by the players the game consists of four core activities raiding dungeons questing dueling kingdom building summoning new adventurers what do we hope to achieve we want pxquest to be completely free to play experience after the initial nft purchase this means no gas or hidden fees to play the game to its fullest extent for those with an investor mindset we also want to deliver assets that grow in value over time and can be traded on the largest marketplaces this paper provides brief explanation of how we have balanced these often competing interests with novel blend of technologies and game mechanics the plot in words pxquest adventurers are all that remain of once great kingdoms destroyed by collapse in time in space calamitous war left most land in fractured time uninhabitable by organic lifeforms with the recent discovery of chronos crystals these survivors can now stabilise time to reclaim land and summon objects and beings from the past all that was lost can be regained if new rivalries dont get in the way unique artworks classes races gameplay raiding players form raiding parties of increasing size to take on quests dungeons and raids of increasing difficulty and reward defeated mobs will drop weapons armour and resources for kingdom building equipable drops will increase stats and victory odds for the characters assigned them all drops are nfts in their own right that can be traded independently on common marketplaces like opensea dueling on chain dueling between players can be used to settle scores and wagers players can wager chronos items resources and more adventurer level equipped items and choice of attack contribute to increasing the statistical odds of victory the final outcome of duels is transparently determined on chain where all can verify its authenticity and fairness kingdom building land pxquest adventurers own land and join lands to form kingdom land is minted on the ethereum mainnet however structures built on land are minted on our layer solution there are just plots of land in pxquest comprised of two categories time fractured land plots unstable land that requires chronos crystals to stabilise and mint before anything can be built upon it stable land plots time stabilised plots that are ready to build upon immediately these are unique plots that will be auctioned for ether prior to launch of the land system before plot is stabilised purchased with chronos the type of terrain is unknown different terrains and different combinations of adjacent terrain will give land different production abilities stats and appearance what do do with land there are several benefits to owning land accumulating resources alliances minting better gear for your raiders unlocking larger dungeon raids titles and skins accumulating resources alliances resources or raw materials are the foundations for kingdom building and crafting in pxquest land plots yield layer resources on daily basis depending on the terrain type at the time of minting land the player also specifies in the same transaction which kingdom they wish to join all landowners in the kingdom receive an increased resource yield based on the number of lands that are part of the kingdom minting crafting gear during raiding adventurers will obtain resources they can use to develop structures on their land such as blacksmiths markets and stables these structures can be used by any kingdom citizen to convert resources and items into superior items armour weapons consumables used in raiding in other words strong kingdom produces rare non character nfts for players raid unlocks dungeons in pxquest come in different sizes with the best loot obtainable in the largest raids dungeons to participate in raids of certain size you must be citizen of kingdom with certain number of structures built structures kingdom level max raid size inc guild hall shire inc trading house county inc citadel kingdom titles skins land owners receive special titles and skins visible in game because they are after all royalty have no land what about me pxquest reflects true feudal system in that the majority of players are landless landless players can however be invited to become the citizen of kingdom which entitles them to certain benefits citizens can join raids of the size unlocked by their kingdom contribute their resources to assist development of structures in the kingdom use kingdom structures like blacksmiths to mint rare items for themselves join private discord channels for their kingdom do whatever else your kingdom decides to build its community summoning aside from land purchases the other key use of chronos is summoning new nft adventurers with chronos crystals and the blood of two gen adventurers player can summon an ancestor from the past the race of the summoned gen ancestor is determined by the particular race combination of the two summoning adventurers on top of this there is no hard cap on race variety out of the gen collection this essentially means generation holders will determine the rarity of gen races by what races they choose to breed however summoning does not stop there top secret redacted chronos what is chronos chronos aka chronos crystal is an erc token on the ethereum mainnet that is required to perform summoning evolving and reclaim time fractured land the chronos token only has value within the pxquest game ecosystem chronos chronos the pxquest developers have no plans to make secondary market for chronos earning chronos chronos crystals can be claimed at rate of per day unclaimed chronos accrues per adventurer held chronos yields will take effect immediately after initial sale smarter cheaper architecture having your cake and eating it too despite the rise of technically viable alternatives the primacy of ethereum mainnet nft market is still undisputable in terms of the number of market participants and value traded however steep mainnet gas fees have prevented the growth of any substantively interactive on chain gaming experiences so how do we reconcile this tension between mainnet nfts being the most valuable yet also the most expensive to interact with introducing our hybrid nft architecture hybrid asset model mainnet layer we understand that players want the ability to trade their most valuable assets with the biggest markets so your core erc nfts are minted on the ethereum mainnet adventurers all gens land plots additionally our erc currency is also most useful when used in conjunction with these assets on the mainnet chronos secondary items that are produced during gameplay are minted gas free as erc on our layer solution weapons armour productive assets land enhancements land resources land yield crucially all layer nfts are fully transferable to the ethereum mainnet meaning if you believe they have market value you can trade them on marketplaces such as opensea gasless raiding using our hybrid asset model players can raid and receive loot without needless burning eth on gas fees interactions are instead limited only where it makes sense as game mechanic to prevent speed running such as raid level requirements boss cooldowns and adventurer revival cooldowns on chain meta randomisation fair and transparent sale if you are reading this far it means that just maybe you care as much about doing things right as we do and this begins at initial sale recent nft launches have been dogged by claims of insider trading as developers had prior knowledge of the identity of the most valuable tokens during the sale process to prevent any possibility of insider trading we have implemented an on chain meta randomisation function that will be called immediately following initial sale anyone can see exactly when and how randomisation has occurred and nobody not even our developers have any way of knowing the outcome in advance this mechanism will instantaneously make the updated final metadata visible to all users upon randomisation such that all market participants have equal knowledge ',\n",

original generative nft brand created in through the advancement of blockchain and nft technology we believe in the future of web and the metaverse and want our uninterested unicorns to have name and place as one of the original nft projects that launched this year in during the up trend of digital collectibles in general the name and brand was originally conceptualised by group of artists led by ryan teo rynja and is one of the leading artists of the nft space today with the success of this early project in uninterested unicorns besides ryan the co founding team also includes terence ting who is managing director at nex labs which owns the uninterested unicorns brand through its newly created subsidiary new moon studios new moon studios also has lim keng hin as our lead blockchain developer and is largely an asian co founding team with our company based in singapore mission to be leading gamefi project creating an enjoyable game experience with huge cultural influence in the general nft space through unis we aim to explore the longterm potential of nfts and how they can fit into the wider idea of metaverse world which bridges the physical and virtual reality gap table of

and ung tokens about us an uninteresting story project info roadmap official links team advisors ucd utility token tokenomics key features an uninteresting story an uninteresting story being magical and cute got boring so the unicorns started fighting to bring excitement to their lives but after while even that wasnt enough so now theyre just uninterested and blas isolating themselves in uni land away from the rest of the metaverse once upon time there was wonderful land filled with butterflies rainbows and beautifully mystical unicorns it was metaverse full of peace friendship and predictability fortunately our story does not take place at that time because what kind of land could survive on these things alone none as it turns out as the years went by the unicorns started to change the lack of spontaneity made them increasingly blas the friendships they made turned to ash once they realised how similar they all were it didnt take long for them to crave something different something dangerous or whatever could help pass the time and make their lives worth living really in the end it seemed like conflict and self promotion provided good reasons to be alive the society of unicorns divided into different clans each clan asserting dominance in one domain fire water air and earth as they expected creating such monopoly over the elements of life resulted in friction between the clans which soon led to wars pinch of vanity was key to pushing them over the edge and really making them feel that actually they were pretty awesome though rivalries were the norm certain clans found themselves more invested in fighting each other than fighting for resources group of unicorns started seeing the others as competition and delighted in finding ways to remove some of their power and use it for themselves piece by piece theyd take away some of the light found in all unicorns as the victims became increasingly darker the thieves became increasingly purer creating two new clans the darks and the pures theyre pretty easy to spot youll see after decades of feuds and narcissism the current generation of clans consists of uninterested unicorns what once brought passion skill and reward is now met with quick judgmental glance and shrug in fact the unicorns have secluded themselves in the grand valley where they can be free to be their uninterested selves without the whining of the other members of the metaverse why bother with basic matters right the unicorns became practically impossible to reach and it is even said that the purest of the uninterested unicorns live in majestic castle and havent been seen in years the uninterested unicorns of the grand valley are the stuff of legends despite this each clan goes about their lives completely numb to the events

amongst the world elite his legacy need only speak for itself so too the ancient samurai often lead simple selfless life according to the bushido code of modesty frugality benevolence and honor sharing much in common with satoshi nakamoto in higher service to society as whole our artist hisoka gaka follows the same path of these influences with desire to express his art in its purest form away from bias tied to his real identity hisoka can be one of the greatest artists in the world or just housekeeper with this question one can see if the art is enough to give you the answer and to elevate this project to the recognition it truly deserves the floating world living in the moment detached from the bothers of life ukiyo key yo japanese project is nft project of erc unique artworks stored on the ethereum blockchain it is celebration of japanese culture and art the artist has picked various different references from japanese history and has created an hommage collection for everyone to enjoy and savour our art has references to classic artwork to everyones favourite miyazaki and kurosawa movie or your nostalgic childish anime series hisoka gaka has allied with professional blockchain and marketing pr companies based in asia to ensure the project longevity our team of experts developed proprietary ai algorithm that splits each of the artist attributes into various components those components are then selected randomly by the generative software to create concoctions each one unique nft portraying the artist work hisoka also strived to bring distinctive aesthetic quality to the art our exceptionally talented artist has spent months creating this body of work spending hours at time working on each of the finer details the authenticity of the classic ukiyo style was respected whilst also referencing popular contemporary styles of japanese digital media what is project at the crossroads between innovation and aesthetics samurais exclusive club great projects do not base their growth solely on hype or paid influencer promotion their focus is on establishing consensus and fostering serious relationships with their most engaged holders we believe that this path is crucial to our development and that is why we have created the samurai exclusive club vip telegram group where the team will meet regularly with the top collectors as well as those most passionate and engaged from the community such investors will often have breadth of experience connections and useful skills to help strengthen the project and allow us to deliver further

tiered presale system to prevent gas wars staking once the primary sales are minted out staking will be our first general milestone by providing staking mechanism to our holders we are building the

              " 'below are details behind the game mechanics of hungry wolves our team has worked tirelessly on this project and taken meaningful input from external advisors who are far smarter than ourselves scott kominers tenured harvard economist the result is something that we believe will be extremely fun and while founded in the ethereum blockchain playablewithoutsignificant gas fees this document is broken into several sections in each section well discuss the mechanics reasons why we made the decisions we did as well as expected timelines for release the hungry wolves mint launched in december and sold out on it was separated into three phases all of which were priced at eth you can now purchase hungry wolves on the secondary market via opensea https opensea io collection hungry wolves hungry wolves nft examples mint phase of the first hungry wolves minted held an alpha rank mint phase of the next hungry wolves minted held an alpha rank the other were betas mint phase of the last hungry wolves minted held an alpha rank the other were betas these phases resulted in alphas and betas that became part of the overall collection to be clear despite their name beta wolves are not secondary members of our pack or community they can do all of the same things as alpha wolves the trait pool is identical they can join wolfpacks collect and eat sheep earn dominance and rewards the one difference between alpha and beta wolves is their hunting prowess beta wolves retrieve smaller prey during regular airdrops well discuss this further in thescrumptious sheep lil lambairdropssection alpha beta logos our nfts each hold metadata trait called rank so you can easily identify if wolf is an alpha or beta this is also the foundation for wolves to be able to steal swap ranks with each other using pvp mechanics discussed later in thepvpsection there are standard of included in our collection one representing each of our wolfpacks and werewolf coins each were distributed at random during our mint werewolf coin holders of werewolf coin have the ability to work with our designers to transform it into of custom hungry wolf based on their specifications all of and werewolf coins initially hold the rank of alpha hungry runtz were announced in late january as free to play layer of the hungry wolves ecosystem they are erc nfts just like hungry wolves you can learn more about runtz athttps runtz hungrywolvesnft com hungry runtz with an expected launch in february runtz will be completely free to mint only pay gas collection runtz are for everyone especially those that are new to nfts the goal is to make them accessible to anyone who wants to explore the hungry wolves project and mechanics with runtz we are also introducing new concept an infinity mint there will be no collection cap with runtz and the mint is designed to run forever runtz are meant to be perpetually available to anyone who wants to join the hungry wolves community hungry runtz beginning with series runtz have hundreds of randomized traits creating millions of combinations at point in the future we will close series and launch series and so on each series will have unique trait pool meaning new traits will be unveiled and some older ones retired forever runtz with specific trait combinations may become rare collectables over time runtz are born into the world of hungry wolves they can join wolfpacks eat sheep earn dominance and even upgrade their visual traits however in most cases runtz must rely on their hungry wolves brothers sisters for assistance due to their size this is discussed further in the sections below once you acquire hungry wolf or runtz you become eligible to join one of wolfpacks based on your nfts unique traits hungry runtz have single trait fur mapped to wolfpacks and each is eligible to join single pack hungry wolves have more complex mapping of traits as shown below and in most cases are eligible to join multiple packs wolfpacks trait map by entering the wolf den via our website you can easily see which wolfpacks each of your hungry wolves or runtz are able to join one of the big questions weve wrestled with should joining wolfpack be wolf or wallet based while our original plan was to allow all wolves to join wolfpacks regardless of how many one held in their wallet we determined this created potential for significant imbalances as well as opportunities for players to cheat not to mention confusion and complexity for those holding large numbers of wolves we decided the right path was to have our players wallet holders choose single wolfpack we want each person to develop genuine affinity for their chosen pack like guild or clan in an mmo this simply isnt possible if everyone can join multiple or even all simultaneously when you enter the wolf den youre asked to choose primary wolf from those available in your wallet this primary wolf is then able to join wolfpack based on its unique traits you can change your primary wolf join leave or switch wolfpacks at anytime while only one hungry wolf or runt per wallet can formally join wolfpack weve ensured that other game mechanics are designed in way where its strategically advantageous to hold multiple more on this in the sections below once your primary wolf joins wolfpack channel will unlock in our discord allowing you to communicate and strategize with your packmates discord wolfpack channels this will be important when it comes time to compete and earn rewards with your wolfpack discussed below under the sectionwolfpack competitions the wolfpacks feature was released on beginning in january we began delivering monthly airdrops to all hungry wolves holders each month on the full moon irl alpha wolves yield scrumptious sheep and beta wolves lil lambs important alpha and beta wolves can eat both scrumptious sheep and lil lambs rank simply determines which variety each type hunts and therefore retrieves during airdrops hungry runtz are too small to hunt on their own and therefore are not eligible to receive airdrops however they caneatscrumptious sheep lil lambs if they acquire them via other means this is discussed further in theeating your sheepsection below lil lamb left and scrumptious sheep right during each airdrop youll receive one scrumptious sheep or lil lamb for each hungry wolf in your wallet but not all of them are the same some are rarer than others and as result worth more dominance when eaten scrumptious sheep and lil lambs come in five varieties each with an associated monthly drop rate scrumptious sheep lil lamb rarity there are different nfts that can be acquired each worth scaling amount of dominance when eaten think of it like menu depending on how hungry you are well get into specifics of this in the next section before we go any further though you should probably ask yourself if you have the constitution to eat this mythical lil lamb if the answer is no you might have hard time playing our game mythical lil lamb weve decided to make these nfts static meaning the same scrumptious sheep lil lambs will be dropped month over month during regular airdrops this is to ensure theyre easily visually identifiable and our opensea collection will always show available nfts for purchase vs getting cluttered with potentially hundreds of extremely similar options however we know that many of our holders have been looking forward to collecting our sheep and having new visual traits available dont worry weve got you covered in addition to our regular monthly airdrops were committing to doing at least one additional drop each month with unique collectable nft sheep designed by our team these will be limited drops and never made available again in the future collectable drops will still be segmented by alpha and beta rank scrumptious sheep vs lil lamb and will be edible albeit for significantly reduced amount of dominance in line with above hungry runtz do not receive collectable drops they are reserved exclusively for hungry wolves holders holiday lil lamb left and scrumptious sheep right our team has launched two collections on opensea hungry farm meant for eating reserved for the static nfts of varying rarity used in our standard monthly airdrops hungry barn meant for collecting reserved for limited drops you can view the traits of each nft to view the amount of dominance the nft is worth when eaten we know youre all hungry so when you eat sheep what happens we mentioned above that there are different potential options to receive in our regular monthly airdrops versions of scrumptious sheep for alpha wolves and versions of lil lambs for beta wolves each based on its rarity is worth an increasing amount of dominance when eaten see the chart below scrumptious sheep lil lamb dominance chart we reserve the right to adjust these figures in the future if we determine it necessary to balance game mechanics based on rarity levels the end result is that alpha wolves will receive scrumptious sheep worthan averageof dominance per month beta wolves will receive lil lamb worthan averageof dominance per month while hungry runtz cannot hunt on their own and therefore dont receive their own airdrops they can eat scrumptious sheep lil lambs in doing so runtz receive of the dominance value compared to hungry wolves as an example if runtz consume common scrumptious sheep they earn dominance vs the listed in the chart above dominance will be wallet based value meaning as you eat your sheep regardless of which hungry wolf or runtz in your wallet consumes them it all adds up to singular value for the wallet holder dominance logo if you consume sheep with your primary wolf dominance earned will also be mirrored and added to total for your wolfpack creating the foundation of wolfpack competitions which is discussed below each hungry wolf in your wallet will be able to consume maximum of three nfts either scrumptious sheep or lil lambs per month before it becomes full runtz due to their small size can only consume one nft per month this was big decision and implemented for variety of reasons lets talk through some examples and implications if you hold single hungry wolf in your wallet youll earn one nft during our monthly airdrop you can acquire up to two more via buying trading and can eat maximum of three scrumptious sheep or lil lambs before you have to wait until the following month to consume more this caps the amount of dominance you can earn via eating each period if you own more wolves you can eat three nfts witheachof them during period significantly accelerating your wallet based dominance earnings as an example if you own wolves youd earn enough sheep during single airdrop to fill up two of them which can be done all at once since only one of your wolves can be your primary wolf and belong to wolfpack it creates balance for wolfpack competitions as eachwalletcan only eat three sheep per month thatalsobenefit your wolfpack this creates incentives for your primary wolf to consume rarer sheep and maximize dominance thats simultaneously attributed to your wolfpack tldr owning more wolves will allow you to significantly accelerate your dominance earnings not only by receiving more sheep via airdrops but being able to consume them more quickly within single wallet while technically you could mint large numbers of runtz to accelerate dominance earnings due to them being free to mint it would come at high cost given they only yield of the dominance value to the wallet all scrumptious sheep and lil lambs are polygon erc tokens there are two major benefits to using this token type theyre stackable in the sense that if you own multiple youll only have one token shown on your opensea profile along with owned counter this is the same for when you visit opensea to purchase sell sheep or view your own wallet holdings erc example they cost virtually nothing to transfer which means that when you eat and therefore burn the nfts gas fees should beextremelyminimal youll be able to enter the wolf den to see your wolf and sheep holdings as well as eat them in bulk through shopping cart like function dominance will then be immediately earned and available to spend our plan is to release functionality allowing you to eat your scrumptious sheep and lil lambs in one of the major goals for our project is to create the ability for you to collaborate and compete alongside your packmates wolfpack logos we shared above that you choose primary wolf from your wallet to join wolfpack when you consume scrumptious sheep or lil lambs with your primary wolf dominance earned will be mirrored attributed to your wolfpack wolfpack competitions will be held on monthly basis at the beginning of each month well take snapshot if wallet address has primary wolf inside wolfpack on that date thats the pack their nft will be part of for purposes of competition and rewards regardless of whether they switch their pack mid month or sell their nft this is to prevent cheating as result any newly acquired wolves will need to wait until new monthly competition starts to participate theyll still be able to join packs and earn dominance in the meantime just not to support the existing competition when we launch this feature well start with simple binary goal for each wolfpack hit or miss it will be to acquire total dominance for the month scaled based on the membership size of each pack if achieved any primary wolf that contributes will receive dominance bonus for its holder hungry wolves designated as primary wolves will receive dominance and runtz designated as primary wolves dominance well design the first goal to be extremely attainable so the majority if not all of the wolfpacks will earn the reward once we observe the first competition well be able to set new bars as well as multiple gates for subsequent ones we expect these competitions to evolve and incorporate different mechanics over time we will also implement versions where only certain number of wolfpacks emerge victorious based on speed to goal or total each month will present new challenges our plan is to implement wolfpack competitions in late pvp challenges will only be for hungry wolves theyre simply too dangerous for runtz there will be two types of pvp challenges in hungry wolves opposing rank beta vs alpha same rank alpha vs alpha beta vs beta for beta vs alpha challenges theres grail at stake the rank metadata tag of the alpha if the beta wins the challenge the beta wolf willbecomethe alpha and in turn the alpha will become the beta but with significant reward comes significant risk risk that the alpha wolves can capitalize on wolf vs wolf if beta wolf wants to challenge an alpha theyll need to risk dominance thats not an insignificant amount given the average yield of lil lamb what the beta wolf receives during monthly airdrops not only that but if an alpha wolf accepts betas challenge the alpha wolf can do so bullishly knowing it has chance to win if the alpha wolf wins the challenge and its statistically likely to do so its wallet holder will acquire of the dominance that the beta put on the table the other is burned as deflationary and anti abuse mechanism for those counting dominance is the equivalent of eating three average scrumptious sheep meaningful bounty if the beta wolf manages to win the challenge it keeps its dominance and switches metadata tags with the alpha this means for all future airdrops the beta wolf now the alpha begins to acquire scrumptious sheep given that opensea does not update metadata immediately we will keep running ledger of recent battles on public page for buyers to reference challenge logo for same rank competitions alpha vs alpha beta vs beta its all about dominance both wolves will put up dominance will be burned and total will go to the winner with chance of either being victorious the challenges will be made inside of the wolf den where player can select the token id of any wolf in the collection and propose challenge if that wolf logs into the wolf den and accepts winner will be determined and spoils delivered accordingly our plan is to make thesehighlyvisible via discord and twitter integration so wolves can challenge others publicly and cheer on the results we will also be implementing leaderboard showing number of challenges won by wolf and wallet we may implement rewards for this at later date while all initial challenges will be random chance we do have ideas on how to incorporate skill into them as well its something well continue to evaluate after the initial mechanics are live and we can generate feedback we also recognize the need to properly incentivize alpha wolves to accept challenges from beta wolves and will adjust over time if necessary the plan is to have pvp challenges rolled out by early of while we expect there to be multitude of ways for you to spend dominance both digitally and physically the most exciting for now will be to upgrade the visual appearance of your hungry wolf via our augment system this means youll be able to permanently change certain aspects of your nft initially five traits of your hungry wolf will be augmentable via this method tier hat or object dominance tier background or tail dominance tier hands dominance runtz will also be able to upgrade their visual traits via the augment system but the tiers will cost of the above due to runtz earning dominance at half the rate via eating and wolfpack competitions specific trait categories initially available to augment for runtz will be announced shortly after public release normal pirate hat left vs diamond pirate hat augment right hungry runtz augment example diamond crown augment to upgrade all five traits on single hungry wolf youll need dominance the goal is for this to be something to strive for and work on over time not to happen overnight though of course those that own multiple hungry wolves will have the means to get there faster we may add additional trait categories over time as well as additional levels of upgrades and even options for you to choose from when you enter into the wolf den with enough dominance youll be able to select one of your hungry wolves or runtz as well as which trait upgrade youd like to purchase if confirmed the mapped ipfs image and metadata of your nft will change to reflect your newly acquired spoils from that point forward the nft is sellable tradable along with its augments there will be method available for you to revert back to the original nft if you choose to do so the traits of the nfts will not change as we do not want this system to affect rarity however we will add new trait to each wolf who has gone through this process called augments with number underneath it this will allow you to track and see via opensea which wolves have changed their visual appearance via the augment system we will also work with rarity tools to ensure this trait is ignored for purposes of rarity of both standard and custom wolves transformed from werewolf coins will not be eligible to use this system at launch they are rare assets in their own right and will remain that way we may devise ways for them to augment their appearance in the future our plan is to release the augment system in for more information wed encourage you to join our discord viahttps discord gg hungrywolves we will be updating this whitepaper as new information becomes available stay hungry

              " 'whitepaper an introduction to the pixa nft ecosystem our whitepaper is divided into two sections the lore backstory for the pixarealm the metaverse all pixa nft assets exist in and the project concise technical description of the project for further technical details on the project read the sections following the whitepaper pixa has been creating in the nft space since february we hope you enjoy reading about what is coming up in the future the lore throughout the history of the multiverse there has always existed some manifestation of what we know as magic independent of the many forms that this cosmic glue has taken on mana joojoo prana aura chi there is and in all likelihood always will be primordial substance existing at the essence of our universe the quest to discover understand and harness this ancient and timeless material has always been one of the primary drivers of cosmic progress nevertheless story told the same way every time is far from what the ageless fates are in the business of doing for them the most entertaining outcome is always the best one and so its with sprinkle of the fantastic hint of cosmic irony and oodles of magic that the fates wove the story of an enchanted corner of the multiverse called the pixarealm our adventure brings us to jangala jungle world blossoming with life located in star system inhabited by rich assortment of flora and fauna its rumored in ancient lore that there are some parts of jangala so remote that mysterious mythical creatures are able to remain hidden there to this very day however rumors of such perils were not enough to deter committed crew of explorers from making their way onto the lush world over time every world in the pixarealm became inhabited what remains alluring about jangala in particular is that the world is host to myriad of peculiar and useful herbs and resources moreover the veil afforded to its inhabitants by the dense jungle canopy makes jangala host to some of the pixarealms most eccentric types as fate would have it the thick wilderness provides the ideal home for the clandestine lab of one of the first pioneers of magical thought in the realm wizard named flynn however at the time of the wizards discoveries things werent quite thought of in magical terms yet there always seemed to be something transcendental about the allure of jangala and its abundant wildlife it was as if flynn had been drawn there by some force the one lens through which flynn could express that mysterious energetic allure was through keen sense of curiosity about the local jangalian flora every day brought new excursion into some of the more remote parts of jangala with each new adventure came the discovery of some curious fungi an exotic budding flower or some glowing fruit flynn meticulously collected samples to bring back to his lab the mage carried on in this way for many moons yet collecting was not enough for the intrepid flynn after devising several instruments that he used to break down some of the dried materials flynn began experimenting with combinations of the unknown elements unbeknownst to him he was the first in his star system to discover the ancient and cosmic tradition of alchemy this ancient artform was the transmutation of elements into novel materials the young wizard was constantly amazed by the reactions that elements underwent after some unique combinations flurries of color filled the air in rich phantasmagoria of stunning visual imagery robust alien scents oftentimes overcame the atmosphere of the laboratory bursts of energetic sounds emanated from sizzling vats of fungi soup cauldrons one day flynn was startled to hear knocking at his door who could have managed to discover his isolated bunker in this deep jungle he quickly answered the door to meet the interloper much to his surprise the young warlock found himself face to face with young woman dressed in rainbow robe and pointed hat her tone was friendly when she introduced herself as juniper and explained to flynn how she had felt something draw her to this part of the jungle with no further explanation to give the two were bewildered at the shared feeling that had brought them both to jangala flynn now feeling less fearful towards juniper proceeded to share tales about all the adventures and discoveries that he had made in the desolate paradise at once he noticed glimmer come over his visitors eyes flynn knew that she would truly appreciate seeing his complete laboratory and so he proceeded to give her tour juniper was mildly impressed by the simple yet elegant setup that she noticed the mage had managed to build for himself she knew that if she could only manage to maintain her cover for another couple of moments that she would be able to find the source of what had brought her there beyond that she knew that securing precious valuable pixa that she suspected was hidden somewhere in flynns laboratory would bring her the favor of the rainbow order of the luna coven surely that would be enough to help her achieve the coveted rainbow rank she wore mere silver sash on her pointed hat flynn still nave to his interlopers true intentions was busy detailing the inner workings of his experiments to juniper he was surprised that she was actually so interested in peering into all of the jars full of potions and other assorted brews that he had concocted when juniper asked about the magical effects of the potions flynn was surprised magical effects surely she must be kidding he was well aware of some of the more astounding effects of light sound and scent that his creations emitted upon their synthesis but he had never deemed any of them safe enough for ingestion who was juniper and how did she know about the potions in the time it took flynn to muse about all those things juniper managed to slip vial of golden colored potion into the pocket of her robe without the wizard noticing it was foretold that rare pixa was golden in color although little else was known about it appearance she thought it was best to bring back the mysterious liquid with her to the coven as opposed to coming back empty handed with her objective complete juniper hastily came up with an excuse for why she had to go and was back on her way to luna few moments after saying goodbye to her new acquaintance it wasnt until later in the afternoon that flynn would realize that one of his potions was missing could this be connected to his visitors claim about magical effects had she actually stolen the potion with the intention to drink it and if so what effect did she expect to happen flynn knew that the only way to find answers would be to create some more and find out for himself after few hours he had another cauldron full of the golden brew bit apprehensive but also determined to get to the bottom of all of the mystery the young wizard gulped down goblet full of his creation oddly enough at first lightly sweet yet tangy flavor filled his palette as funny euphoria simultaneously settled over him the last thing that he remembers is the unusually sudden burp that he surprised himself with at the end of another few large sips meanwhile the coven prepared itself for the rainbow orders full moon ceremony that evening there was an added sense of anticipation in the air as all of the attendees were looking forward to the unveiling of new golden potion that witch had discovered somewhere off world word travelled fast among the coven members in luna the iridescent moon world at the furthest extremity of the pixarealm as such the evenings ceremony was in full attendance witches from every rank filled the atrium of an opulent stories high marble castle that houses each new moons ceremony the ritual was always one of reverent celebration during the new moons the witches took advantage of the amplified magical energy in their world by partaking in some of their magical potions and studying them being the one who said that she had discovered the new potion juniper was given the honor of being the one to sample the potion at the exact dawn of the new moon and so overcome with anticipation and an unrelenting conviction to rise in rank juniper swallowed an entire goblet of the golden potion and waited then she waited some moreyet she didnt really notice any effects other than her cheeks becoming delightfully warm anxious to know more one of the witches from the high council asked her to describe how she felt juniper felt as if she responded normally but the gibberish that came out of her mouth was only partly discernible everything else was slurred mess it was clear that the poor young witch was in some way incapacitated half of the coven was in bursts of laughter as the other half watched in awe as juniper fumbled around attempting to regain her composure after stumbling over the ceremony was ruined the council had no choice but to send the patrons home yet curiosity about the evenings events still loomed among the coven was this mysterious new potion curse or something else that they didnt understand this was clearly not the pixa they had been looking for that promised to advance their rank as witches the same thoughts plagued flynn as he struggled out of bed the next day and also wondered if he hadnt somehow mildly enjoyed what had just happened to what would ensue within the pixarealm after those events is nothing short of magic in an effort to create more of the golden brew the coven of witches found way to derive the recipe which had become cult classic of sorts among their ranks our wizard also continued to refine his many variations of the original brew which he called pixabrews and word of their legendary effects spread throughout all of the worlds of the pixarealm factions and creatures from all worlds were fascinated by this new but objectively silly discovery beyond that the alchemical experiments of both the wizards and witches would continue to flourish as result of this uncanny series of events and renaissance of magical thought and discovery would flourish in all of the worlds of the pixarealm star system although they had originally been searching for magic this accidental creation set off an era of bizarre conflict between the wizards and witches who could provide the most potent brew in the pixarealm enter the pixarealm as all of your favorite pixa nfts the pixarealm ecosystem consists of faction companion item and land nft assets on the ethereum blockchain erc standard there will be total of faction collections two of which have already launched pixawizards february and pixawitches october all the factions and their creature companions inhabit the ten worlds of the pixarealm the culmination of which is complete metaverse with playable game and robust tokenomics the premise of the pixarealm metaverse centers around the conflict ensuing among the factions as they compete to create the best brew in all of the realm each faction nft has matching playable vx avatar which can be used to navigate the ten worlds within the metaverse game additionally land within the metaverse can be owned by players through holding land asset nfts the decentralized adventure takes on whole new creative dimension with land owners being able to choose where they live in any one of the ten various worlds within the pixarealm all of which are connected through magic portals land owners have four sizes to choose from basic deluxe premium and estate land isnt just for show pixarealm land is rich with truly magical resource elixir deposits of elixir exist on all land in the pixarealm and can be mined to acquire the precious resource these mines produce exlr which can be used to create potions that summon in game vx pixa assets that players can mint cast spells and will act as resource to summon certain pixa nft assets it counterpart is the scarcer in game currency token pixa which is essential for funding the mining of elxr powerful mage is sure to stockpile both besides tending to their parcels land owners have some additional challenges to take into consideration over the ages several factions formed bonds with different species of legendary creatures these creatures have now been trained by competing factions to steal precious elixir from mines the initiated warlocks know of the proper relics to fend off those pesky beasts it is foretold that throughout the pixarealm there are relics of many forms that provided their holders protection from thieving creatures best of luck with gaming out your strategies wizards and witches cheers the project pixa nft was founded in february and creates nfts that exist in our metaverse called the pixarealm our project goal is to make the most decentralized immutable nft collections metaverse that is possible on the ethereum blockchain many other major projects in the nft space are investor funded and will likely never relinquish centralized control which is why we believe it is important to decentralize our project to ensure it will be accessible forever this direction is in the true spirit of the crypto space decentralized immutable platform free of censorship that can be accessible forever by users of the pixa nft ecosystem our fantasy themed nfts depict mystical world of wizards wyverns and artifacts based around an absurd generations long struggle to create the best brew the realm has ever tasted there are different categories these nfts fall into collectible assets metaverse assets land assets specialty assets collectible assets include the classic nfts you see in the space right now mostly focused around providing an autogenerated profile picture for social media these nfts are pixel art and depict one of three categories faction creature or an item we have added some utility to the rarity aspect of two collections upgradable pixawitches and creature but overall these are mainly collectibles there are even hidden traits not included in the metadata that the community gets to uncover however when these nfts are combined with land assets they hold very important utility in generating our native erc tokens more on that below read more on collectible assets here collectible assets metaverse assets are the versions of the collectible assets but with an expanded scope for example instead of only factions in the collectible asset category there will be factions total in the metaverse asset category these assets are mainly for use as cross compatible metaverse avatars pets or wieldable items that can be interoperable across multiple platforms for example the sandbox read more on metaverse assets here metaverse assets land assets provide the opportunity for community members to own land in our upcoming metaverse the pixarealm demo out now these land nfts are unique as users will be able to use them to claim land where they want to in the metaverse this opens up the possibility of decentralized city building where like minded users can choose to build near each other which has not been done in blockchain based metaverse before these land nfts also produce resource token called elxr which can be boosted and even stolen based on the collectible assets you own or stake for specific purposes see land assets for details the dual purpose land nfts are the gamified nfts in the ecosystem specialty assets each have specific role to play in the ecosystem and range from voting rights see the wizardao to collecting of the pixarealm see pixale limited editions to funding real world community hangout see mystic brewing read more about the purpose of these unique nfts and how they contribute to the pixa ecosystem here specialty assets the main currency of the pixarealm and the pixa nft project in general is the pixa token pixa this token has no set maximum supply but has unique tokenomics based on how often the token is being transferred the tokenomics are also tied to the land nfts which include giveaway and burn mechanic to redistribute and control the supply this mechanic is controlled by on chain wizardao voting our community governance body and can be increased or decreased to adjust based on supply and demand for the token read more about this in utility tokens pixa and elxr community governance is controlled by the wizardao where membership requires wizardao token nft depicting golden wizard hat designed by emmy award winning artist tim riopelle the dao controls to certain degree the tokenomics of pixa to ensure the long term success of this project decades into the future this allows for the token to be flexible and to adapt to changing supply and demand situations in the community major goal of this project is to have truly decentralized metaverse called the pixarealm as of december we have demo available for this metaverse and building this out is the primary focus of the metaverse and land assets will both be usable in world along with both utility tokens pixa and elxr the metaverse is built using the unity game engine and requires stand alone application to run in we plan to decentralize this infrastructure as much as possible creating final version of pixarealm and uploading it build files and executable to arweave to ensure it will be available for download forever major hurdle we plan to tackle is decentralizing the server structure itself more details on the pixarealm can be found here the pixarealm one of the last goals of our project is to create marketplace specifically for pixa nfts this will be zero fee marketplace where users can freely trade using either pixa or elxr as the currency denominations this will be the last piece of the puzzle to ensure our ecosystem can continue functioning well into the future without reliance from centralized marketplaces finally we reach our ip ownership policy which is very simple nft owners hold the ip ownership to the media and metadata of their token we are working with our lawyers to determine the best way to achieve this in legally effective but also straightforward manner we do retain ownership of the pixa brand and all logos associated with it continue reading onward through the following sections to understand the details of this complex ecosystem after the project core there is section on the bonus perks that come along with being member of the pixa nft ecosystem some perks are small but some are huge cheers and happy reading this section outlines the core parts of the pixa ecosytem the project core are all the aspects of this project that we believe are essential to the project future when ensuring the project is immutable the core parts will be the top priority pixa nft collections are split into categories collectible assets metaverse assets land assets and specialty assets brief descriptions of each category are provided below collectible assets are pixel art nfts these nfts are mainly collectibles but can also be used with land assets to increase production of elxr read more in land assets below certain collectibles can be upgraded as well see pixawitches rank trait there are subcategories of collectible assets factions creatures and items metaverse assets are voxel models for use in metaverses such as the pixarealm and sandbox these can be first person avatars companions mounts and items that can be wielded there are the same subcategories of metaverse assets factions creatures and items land assets are dual purpose nfts that allow you to own an area of land in the pixarealm metaverse and these nfts have elixir mines built into them which generate the elxr resource specialty assets are mixture of other nft collections that pixa has created that have specific purpose in the pixa ecosystem for example the wizardao nft tokens fit into this category voting nft also and collaborations that show aspects of the pixarealm fit into this category collectible assets these nfts are mainly collectibles but some can be upgraded and others can also be used with land assets to increase production of elxr collectible assets are generative pixel art nfts and they are the heart of the pixa nft project they are mainly just collectibles but have some utility built into them in terms of changing the metadata or the nft or generating one of our utility tokens read more about each subcategory below factions pixawizards details supply ethereum erc contract history the pixawizards were launched in february and were minted slowly over the course of month this was the second collection created by pixa utility stake in land nfts for elxr generation multiplier details the pixawizards are the first faction released these nfts are the core of the pixa project and were minted in february before many other popular nft projects pixawitches details supply ethereum erc contract history the pixawitches were launched in october utility stake in land nfts for elxr generation multiplier spend pixa to upgrade the rank trait of your witch there are upgradable ranks bronze silver gold crystal rainbow this updates the metadata and also gives your witch colored band on their hat you can only upgrade you can never downgrade you can upgrade your witch on our app on our website app pixanft com details the pixawitches are the second faction released these are the follow up collection to the wizards and double the collection size vs creatures pixawyverns details supply ethereum erc contract history the pixawyverns were launched in april utility passively earn stolen elxr from elixir mine withdrawals from other land nft owners no staking required this is randomly determined using chainlink vrf details the pixawyverns are the first creature collection and are the companions of the pixawizards the wyverns are very limited collection at only items and do not have upgradable traits tba details supply ethereum erc contract history coming soon utility upgradable like the pixawitches details coming soon passively earn stolen elxr from elixir mine withdrawals from other land nft owners no staking required this is randomly determined using chainlink vrf items relics of the pixarealm supply types time limited mints ethereum erc contract history the relics of the pixarealm were launched in september utility defend your elxr mine on your land asset nft from those pesky creatures looking to steal from your withdrawals reduce the of the time your mine will be raided by staking relic in your land nft details relics are from an earlier time in the pixarealm and have been unearthed by the factions that currently roam the worlds these are free mints that are bonus for early members of the pixa community tomes of the pixarealm supply ethereum erc contract history coming soon utility the owner can choose to use these nfts for either stake in pixarealm land nft for boosts to elxr production hold in wallet to gain abilities and spells outlines in the tome details there are types of tomes tome of prosperity tome of enchantment tome of darkness and tome of vitality there are also the worlds of the pixarealm the tome can be from combining these aspect you can therefore mint desertum tome of vitality or luna tome of darkness when minting the user picks type and is minted tome from random world using chainlink vrf these nfts can only be minted by burning elxr but the price to mint tome goes up over time metaverse assets these nfts are for use in supported metaverses such as the sandbox or pixarealm metaverse asset smart contracts are designed to emulate other successful and partnered metaverse ready avatars such as voxodeus and cyberkongz the similar contract structure ensures that our models will be usable in sandbox and most likely other metaverses that follow their standards we will also be linking additional model types to the contract that will be accessible through read functions to ensure regardless of the metaverse these assets will be able to be integrated note all metaverse assets are either free claims or are available for exchange via pixa or elxr these assets are not for primary sale in ether as always any nft can be resold on marketplaces such as looksrare or opensea factions pixafactions vx details supply ethereum erc contract this collection holds all the voxel faction assets with each faction type ie wizards witches included in the metadata as trait there are faction types history coming soon creatures pixacreatures vx details supply ethereum erc contract this collection holds all the voxel faction assets with each faction type ie wizards witches included in the metadata as trait there will be creature types history coming soon items pixaitems vx details supply ethereum erc contract this collection will hold all voxel item assets relics will be included in this and will be designated as trait in the metadata also included in this will be the witch and wizard items ie pyro swords familiars etc there are only ways to acquire additional items magical items magical items can only be summoned by burning elxr valuable items valuable items can only be bought by spending pixa history coming soon land assets these are dual purpose nfts that allow you to own land in the pixarealm and generate elxr owning pixarealm land nft entitles you to claiming piece of land in the pixarealm metaverse they also produce our resource token elxr land claims in world will occur after the land sale before the end of on track for the relative size of each land claim class is detailed below basic land deluxe land premium land estate land therefore estate land claim space is larger than basic claim in terms of space including vertical build height every land claim will be cubic there are total land nfts basic land deluxe land premium land estate land generating elxr to generate elxr you first need to activate the elixir mine on your land claim nft please note that elixir mines are not separate nft they are embedded in your land claim nft activation of the mine is completed by staking pixa to activate the mine once activated mine is always active even when traded to new owner land claims produce different amounts of elxr depending on the parcel size this is called the base production basic land elxr per year deluxe land elxr per year premium land elxr per year estate land elxr per year there is also chance of striking pixa which means you also receive the pixa accumulated in the land contract pixa accumulates in the contract over time due to the tokenomics of the pixa token read utility tokens pixa and elxr you have chance of striking pixa on every elxr withdrawal additionally there is chance of destroying pixa meaning the pixa accumulated in the land contract is instead sent to the burn address this burn rate can be changed via an on chain wizardao voting system the elxr production of each can be boosted dramatically by meeting production multipliers as described below work the mine multiplier stake pixawizard or pixawitch nft fund the mine multiplier stake pixa in the mine elxr will be produced by these mines until the trillion elxr in the land contract is exhausted builder note in the future the community could build feedback loop of elxr to re fund the land smart contract these mines may potentially produce more elxr in the future if there is elxr in the land smart contract the mines will produce this is potential area for the pixa builders community to get involved withdrawing from an elixir mine each time you withdraw you reduce base production by of the original production amount therefore if you withdraw times you will have exhausted your mine and no more elxr will be produced you can also benefit from the elxr withdrawal activities of others you can also get your elxr stolen during withdrawals read below for how this works raid the mine chance of getting of another elxr miners withdrawal own creature collectible asset nft in your wallet on any owners elxr withdrawal mine has chance of being raided the elxr reward is randomly assigned to creature and sent directly to that wallet striking pixa is safe from raids can steal pixa defend the mine reduce chance of your withdrawal being raided from stake relic of the pixarealm in land nft on any withdrawal your risk of being raided by creature is reduced to instead of you also have the option of withdrawing your staked pixa from the elixir mine however if you withdraw you can never stake pixa again for the fund the mine multiplier even if it traded this is to discourage users from staking unstaking pixa from their mines regularly in order to gain the large multiplier you need to be willing to lock your pixa away long term activation pixa pixa to activate the mine is available to withdraw by the owner of the land nft after year from the time of activation land sale information the public sale land supply will be divided into identical land sales there is also elxr minting bonus the minter receives an amount of elxr directly to their wallet the prices of each class of land is detailed below basic eth bonus elxr deluxe eth bonus elxr premium eth bonus elxr estate eth bonus elxr note this pricing is preliminary and may change there will be an allowlist aka whitelist for the land sales how this will be done is tba developer marketing supply from the above supply pixa will retain number of parcels for marketing purposes and for our own in world developments estates premium deluxe and basic elxr distribution of free land nfts to the community certain amount of the land will be claimable for fixed period of time if you claimed your pixa rewards while the rewards system was running the amount of land to be distributed is tba distribution of the free nfts will occur after the land sales basic land nft will be claimable for fixed period of time if you have either pixawizard pixawitch pixawyvern or creature nft you will receive one basic land for each of these collectibles you own distribution of the free nfts will occur after the land sales note we are looking into system where if you have multiple claims you can upgrade to the next level of land ie multiple basics deluxe if you want to claim that way specialty assets specialty nft collections that have very specific use cases the wizardao token nft there are wizardao nfts that depict golden wizard hat and were designed by emmy award winning artist tim riopelle every pixawizard has free wizardao nft to claim you can check on our app to see if wizard still has claim available app pixanft com the wizardao nfts are used to vote on community direction and use of dao funds read the wizardao pixale limited editions this collection are all hand made nfts that add to the lore of the pixarealm both the pixa nft team and community artists contribute to this collection pixa lore we will be deploying smart contract that points to pdf file hosted on arweave that holds all the base lore in the pixarealm this is community built and will be locked at the end of unchangeable this is not an nft builders note although the lore is set in stone after the end of users in the future will be able to creatr additional lore collections through the wizardao validation token wvt this token allows for more collections to be added into the dis',\n",

put their own creative interpretation on each album and trait therefore we are left with incredible unique artwork that exists only in the tools of rock catalog and your collections situation overview the problem while the common adage is that we are all early in the nft space the truth of the matter is the market is quickly becoming saturated by low effort projects bad actors anon teams cash grabs pump and dumps and gluttonous amount of animal avatar projects among many others we are seeing tidal wave of new users join our nft ranks eager and excited to learn about this unbelievable medium we operate in all to be washed out by one of the aforementioned culprits they leave our amazing bubble and go back and systematically tell their friends that nfts are fraud and they lost money thus creating seismic damage and preventing industry growth further mainstream adoption and ultimately impacting all of us in some way shape or form additionally and in line with the avatar projects we mentioned above there is distinct lack of creativity in space that is driven by some of the most creative and progressive people in the world we as collective nft sphere got stuck in rut and innovation has stalled in many respects the low hanging fruit of the next quick flip return and projects that conceive to launch in week have permeated our industry there has been resurgence in projects deviating from the norm focusing on premium art high quality project design and unique utilityso there is hope we can come back from the abyss of an overly fragmented homogenized market love

opportunity for innovation and an expansion of the old norms tools of rock believes that it is that innovator and revolutionary nft the team is not anonymous the roadmap is vividly clear and the art is far from low effort as this has been in construction now for over two months an eternity in nft time the future extends far beyond the mint date and this is one of if not the first nft that views

              " 'vempire ddao democratic decentralised autonomous organisation the front line against centralisation original draft whitepaper by romulus remus written by dominic ryder romulus empire digital remus empire digital this document serves to outline the vempire ddao new fairer system of dao which rewards honour and loyalty to the ddao in more or equal measure to monetary contributions the empire goal is to highlight centralisation in supposedly decentralised projects bring power back to the communities where their founders contributors and whales have and will not relinquish control the empire serves to invade and remind these projects that stakeholders share equal value to token owners moreover decentralisations lack of regulation can and has shown to lead to monopolies when unchallenged by the community this is especially prevalent where voting rights coins and or nfts are centred around small percentage of high token wallets the empire first conquest invasion will be the metaverse metaverse projects here we establish our base and begin the elimination of centralisation from the decentralised world there are many reasons for entering the metaverse as our initial conquest the empire is open to diplomatic solutions and so we plan to establish embassies upon scouting of these projects we have found them to be straying from their values and allowing centralised entities to take an unreasonable share of power from the communities they serve the monopolies and corporates in these metaverses have so much power that they are now leasing property keeping up to plus of the profits whilst leaving the users community with fractional percentage the gaming community in the real world has always been shoehorned into using the same large corporate gaming providers independent developers creators have been pushed out and forced into wage labour for these gaming giants the empire cannot allow the gaming community to be forced again but now in the virtual world into the hands of these gaming giants the vempire ddao distributes value generated by basket of pools and lp services to stakeholders the ddao functions as cooperative whereby stakeholders earn vempires token vemp for providing collateral and via staking mechanism receive share of the fee revenues generated by supported defi services pools nfts and any fees generated from the ddaos contributions on the platform or in any metaverse the vemp work token effectively encapsulates the intrinsic value of the vemp services basket the vemp token can be staked into xvemp to grant pro rata governance rights over all operation concerns of the defi services provision income generated for the empire will be gifted to xvemp holders staking derivatives will also be enabled via locked pools on top of the supported defi protocols the vemp tokens vempire gamer token vemp xvemp xsvemp the empire invasion of the metaverse the ddao democratised decentralized autonomous organization token distribution and protecting our soldiers vemp token airdrop the empire compounds apy inside strategies whilst you compound outside incentivising metaverse tokens onto the platform land leasing buying maintenance of the ddao metaverse limitations vegas city metaverse group ventures founders who wont let go marketing development schedule marketing schedule development schedule tokenomics emission schedule inflation table the battles playing card game the empires gladiators and the kings of men fair game lore trading card games wearables no soldier left behind card proof of concept disclaimer the vemp tokens vempire gamer token vemp integral to the protocol is the vemp token this is the native token for the empire and is the currency used to reward trading card battle winners liquidity providers stakers and the ddao at present metaverses only have mana or other native tokens being used on world for content eventually we would hope to be in position to influence vemp onto the platform as well upon successful launch of the land and estates purchased will be monetized and rebuilt in the aesthetiques of the empire all profits will be distributed to the ddao the first parcels of land are likely to be an embassy nft art gallery for purchase of trading cards vempire wearables colosseum gladiator gambling and nfts chariot racing track gambling and charioteer nfts army barracks bedsit native metaverse token charged per nights stay vemp drop into wallet effectively foreign exchange service until vemp can be accepted onto other worlds xvemp governance token vemp holders can stake their tokens for xvemp this will earn them rewards and voting rights in the ddao which will give them control of the empire invasion conquest and expansion as profits from battles and later monetized land gets gifted to the ddao xvemp holders the value of xvemp will rise meaning rewards are harvested upon unstaking from the ddao this rewards loyalty to the empire as early stakers will benefit as illustrated by the equation below interest rate as decimal years for examples below months vemp xvemp for examples below year vemp xvemp ddao launches vemp xvemp day soldier stakes and receives the above as no rewards have yet been distributed the ddao as an example sits at apy which is gifted over the next months months later new soldier joins the empire and stakes vemp this vemp is worth xvemp as the xvemp has had months of rewards already paid at apy year later months on from the example directly above at the same apy vemp is now worth xvemp this incentivises early adoption as xvemp should only increase in value against vemp xsvemp battle token for soldiers to train and fight battles xvemp is allocated into pools which will effectively burn percentage of the tokens and reward them to the battle winners the pools will differ in percentage burns so people can take as much risk as they please see section for details the empires invasion of the metaverse why the metaverse most have daos the empires mission is to remind decentralised entities across the blockchain universe of their commitment to their users and communities there are few areas where decentraland for example has strayed from this https decentraland org blog announcements security council aside from the dao we think there should be group of people tasked with preventing and handling security issues on land and estate contracts this group of people which were calling the security advisory board will effectively act as guarantors of contract security tasked with the job of providing swift response to bug reports the announcement above from decentraland introducing the security council was based on responding to tech security however the council has now evolved to overseeing all proposals these five individuals deciding what is and isnt badly intended or that could harm the ecosystem the empire wishes the security council return to its previous purpose https docs decentraland org decentraland community voting we would like to take this opportunity to assure the security council that we have nothing but good intentions and will cause no harm our purpose is to give decentraland back its namesake and we see this as an honourable quest the empire is also against outside centralised entities leasing their land parcels and taking anything over of the profits there should be equality harmony amongst businesses and users in the metaverese without one profiteering from the other the vempire ddao will invade by continuously purchasing land in metaverse protocols until we have solid and overwhelming presence by directing emissions to sand mana starl axs pools initially on the platform it will give substantial yield which we hope would intend to capture the majority of the market there will be for metaverse staking as no other protocol is doing what vempire plans to do the ddao democratised decentralized autonomous organization standard daos voting power is decided by the number of governance tokens the wallet that is voting holds rather than democratic vote this means that founders developers and high net worth investors have an advantage over the many in standard dao the empire soldiers have the same rights as the empires officers generals when it comes to democracy governance and so all wallets holding over will have one vote the only reason it is not is bots having this lower threshold can lead to bots and so all votes will be reviewed for suspicious activity and to prevent sybil attacks the empire rewards loyalty above all loyalty comes with promotions promotions come with rewards as this is ddao and not dao we reward based on time spent staked and not amount staked of course as above this is open to abuse by bots so the minimum amount of xvemp needed to qualify for the ranks below is monetary amount equating to there are no ranges above this and promotions can still be earnt by smaller wallets but these will be from applications submitted and reviewed wearables and banners will be customised for the different levels any amount of xvemp staked auxiliary of xvemp staked for one year legion of xvemp staked for two years bannerman of xvemp staked for three years centurion of xvemp staked for five years officer of xvemp staked for ten years general see section for details on wearables applications for promotions outside of the above criteria token distribution and protecting our soldiers the founders will not sell tokens worth more in monetary value than their previous paye incomes earned prior to creation of the project at any point in the first year of the project the founders will sell no tokens at all unless the circulating supply is worth well in excess of million in the first year the founders have also agreed they will never sell tokens worth more than their previous incomes any year after that until the projects circulating supply is worth significantly more than million this does not include token sales for development which will be decided by the ddao upon completion of the above agreement is only changed if the circulating supply of tokens hits in market capitalisation where the limits are moved to percentages beginning at developers and early contributors with tokens in excess of will have of their tokens locked for minimum of five years vesting linearly token holders not in excess of will have their tokens locked for minimum of months vesting linearly vemp token airdrop the empire has no quarrel with and loves the people and users of the metaverse it is the greedy large centralised estate owners we wish to battle with the empire wants to show the people of all worlds that we come in peace existing users landowners will be able to claim wearables from www empire digital upon launch of the platform selected worlds will qualify for these wearables as ever the empire rewards loyalty and those who claim and wear the empire colours in respective metaverses will qualify for the airdrop of vemp for land owners to qualify you should add the vemp logo colours to your land and houses to show solidarity with the project and the empires invasion the empire can and will evolve through the ages with the buildings and units in the metaverse effectively invading from the iron age and releasing nfts and features in more recent ages as the empire expands to new horizons if relationships develop with other projects that support our cause then these too may be included for vemp distribution the empire compounds apy within its strategies for consistent apy growth even with increased volume the empires strategies are unique in that not only can the user compound apy by staking yield from one pool into another themselves the strategies are also designed to naturally compound yield by reinvesting profits to buy more land this means that the additional land monetized will grow the apy so that increased users of the strategy will not necessarily have detrimental effect on the yield of the pools as it would in most other pools on defi daos incentivising metaverse tokens onto the platform the empires initial conquest remains the metaverse with the first voyage destined for decentraland the sandbox starlink axie infinity the empire plans to raise warchest with the below strategy this strategy below as an example as always rewards honour loyalty by providing early stakers with yields in both vemp and in this case sand the other strategies are the same process except axs which provides returns in slp axs for triple yield aggregation the sand staked is locked in the strategy for months and the contributors to the strategy are rewarded forever for the time they remain staked the initial yield will be purely vemp incentivised by the emissions schedule this will be paid for set number of months whilst land is purchased continually and monetised using the stakers sand once the land is providing an income the strategy will yield both vemp sand until the full supply of vemp is circulating eventually the emissions schedule will stop providing yield to this strategy but by this time the land purchased will be vast sufficiently monetized that the strategy will still remain an attractive place for soldiers to stake their sand or other tokens as they will still be rewarded with yield in their tokens from all the empire territories land leasing buying maintenance of the ddao the ddaos multiple and initial revenue streams are illustrated below as well as metaverse tokens the vemp staked onto the platform xvemp can act as collateral in order to borrow from aave and others to stake tokens into off platform strategies that will pay yields higher than the apy paid on the funds borrowed the profit made will be paid back to the ddao xvemp stakers the ddao will also decide if percentage will be converted to metaverse tokens to buy additional land for the empire we will also lease land from property and estate owners for fixed term apys allowing fair and equal revenue streams from both the metaverse population the token holders and from the metaverses private landlords this land will be monetized and profits will be split with the below example using mana with redistributed to xvemp holders and the other being converted to mana used to purchase more land metaverse limitations multiple projects have suffered from similar lack of imagination by applying real world games to virtual world the empire will look to expand and bring games and monetization which can only be possible in the virtual world alongside allowing access to real world favourites if desired the empire has found other tokens and daos in this space suffer from few limitations barriers to entry governance votes where in some cases users need over just to vote rewards shared amongst daos other protocols in this space will also only allow those who partake in governance to benefit from rewards the empires purpose however is to serve our loyal supporters not to take advantage and reward those who have the biggest wallets this is why governance proposals will be set at an acceptable monetary minimum which will start at rather than percentage of tokens in distribution and all xvemp owners will share in the rewards vegas city metaverse group ventures founders who wont let go metaverse group decentraland have invested in vegas city which is ok however the economy of decentraland is changing with this and the empire is seeing whales and centralised entities buying significant estates and leasing the land keeping of profits whilst the renters keep the flamingos vegas city land scarcity combined with corporates are pricing individual land owners out of decentraland with multiple districts owned by the same individuals our ddao will fight for change amongst the population of the metaverse and seek to unite the land for fairer and more prosperous future for all by implementing and advocating for limits on the amount of rental properties and rental income that can be gained from land leasing the empire conquest is to save the population and property owners of the land from becoming capitalist haven of advertising centralised corporations and to prevent the commoditization of users who will occupy the land when there is nothing but slot machines and adverts development schedule with developers on board from the start layer completion of basic platform with nfts launched on opensea ability to connect eth wallets onto the website layer nft boosts working fully functioning trading card game launched on platform layer this can coincide with layer if development is quick enough launch vemp and airdrop to land owners who connect to the platform and advertise vemp on their land buildings wearables giveaway on platform for metaverse token holders who connect to the platform and equip their empire wearables in the metaverse layer create the liquidity pools and the vempire ddao layer set start the emissions schedule to incentivise metaverse token staking the majority of emissions from the blocks will be given to the initial pools with space for diversification to follow into other strategies or projects the empire assesses layer land donations leasing on and to the platform convert land to empire aesthetics and begin the invasion of the metaverse by using the tokens staked to buy land for vempires ddao tokenomics emission schedule the initial supply of vemp will be in years one to three vemp will be minted at per block reducing to per block in years four to twelve per block in years thirteen to nineteen and per block in years twenty and twenty one this equates to total supply of vemp or vemp tokens printed block rewards tokens minted per year inflation table the battles the arena the playing card game the empire is coming to invade the metaverse but before that the leader of the empire is to be decided between romulus remus whoevers side has the most successful battles will have their colours and shields led into battle not all will have the courage for the arena vemp is staked for xvemp xvemp can be staked burnt at pre agreed level which dictates the battle pool which will give the players xsvemp this is worth the same as xvemp minus the percentage for the battle pool they have entered to fight in the arena is great honour to risk one tokens for the advancement of the ddao shows the true character of the soldiers these brave gladiators will gain riches upon winning but their losing counterparts bravery will not go unnoticed by the ddaos emperors people in the arenas pools can battle others for it and win tokens equivalent to their burn plus their opponents burn minus platform fee which will be distributed to the ddao xvemp holders example of burn pool battle discrete time markov chain xsvemp battle players entering the arena xsvemp holders will automatically have their eth address entered into weekly monthly vemp airdrop lottery to further incentivise battle for every loss incurred their address will be entered again into the airdrop lottery so losers will have an increased chance of recouping some of their loss losers will also earn vempcon contributor points which can be swapped for additional trading cards the empires gladiators and the kings of men the empire understands that entering into the arena is not without risk to those with the bravery every month those staked into xsvemp and residing in the arena will have chance to partake in gladiator fight for all the ddaos support the prize will come from the ddao and will not risk the soldiers own funds the soldiers will be chosen by the ddao and will likely be those amongst us with the most fearless reputations fair game as above losers are given trading card in exchange for their loss of xvemp xsvemp this will make it easier for the losers to win future battles however the card cannot and will not be worth more than the loss as this would incentivise players to lose the trading card given for loss will not be an nft this way it gives them an advantage for the future but not financial incentive xvemp holders will earn percentage of yield based on cut of xsvemp burnt for battles between xsvemp holders xsvemp holders will earn additional tokens from battles they win from opponents but xsvemp holders would also get xvemp yield plus the additional yield tokens from battles they partake in and win however they can also lose in their fights trading card game battle will be built first layer then will be actioned post token which will be the preparation and invasion of the metaverse depending on the method results of the invasion players will have the option to build houses forts towers or whatever they please with the potential to siege each other for rewards vempire is split into two rival factions romulus remus the ddao will be collection of both factions together players eth addresses are automatically assigned their faction based on monthly voting power and battles won this means that for month romulus holders may have an advantage over remus holders and the next month it may be different this adds token purchase incentives to maintain competitiveness and liquidity for the project whilst making sure that one faction will not have control over voting for long period to maintain level playing field voting power is rebalanced by new entrants to the project being assigned to the faction with the lower voting power and or active voters factions will have different unlockable features nfts as well as colour codes lore after years of quietly building military strength and governing the surrounding areas the time has come for the empire to expand its borders and seek out new places to rule the empire has set its sights on the metaverse where there is the opportunity to invade the land of others and place the population under its command using the efficient military training honed over time and the passion of its people the empire will soon encompass everything in its path all is not as unified as it may seem however after the peaceful reign of the former emperor his two sons vy for leadership of the powerful empire romulus and remus never saw eye to eye and each brother wont let the other get in the way of unlimited power romulus is strong leader of men who wins the hearts of his people with responsibility and promises of power and wealth remus is the true son of the wolf he is sly and conniving and he will use underhand tactics in order to gain the advantage in battle he may not be as popular as romulus but he will not be bested easily when it comes to playing the long game each brother comes with their own army with unique abilities and troops at their disposal use different soldiers for different scenarios to overcome any advantage the opponent might think they have over you take the all out attack approach and throw strong troops at your opponent to win through brute force or use your cunning and outplay your opponent by strategically removing their key players and increasing the number of cards in your hand choose faction and back brother to the end seeing him to his rightful place as the new emperor train your army invest your time and resources into building an unstoppable force and take what belongs to you then you will see your colours flown as far as the eye can see in the conquest of the metaverse and beyond trading card ideas themes each faction has finite deck featuring certain number of cards in total there are multiples of every card except the named soldiers and heroes when playing game the player will choose legion of total of cards and their hand is randomly assigned cards from their legion all players will start with at least one of every regular card plus basic version of the faction leader boosts are available by purchasing them as nfts this will increase damage abilities by certain percentage as well as give strong perks to apply as an advantage in battle unique soldier cards can only be purchased as nfts as well as higher level shiny versions that have stronger perks and higher strength as well as giving the player bragging rights players can purchase packs of certain amount of cards which guarantees them at least one shiny or unique card wearables no soldier left behind upon promotion through the empires ranks soldiers will receive wearable reflecting their achievement and loyalty this standard armor can be upgraded collected changed at will armor from any rank will be available to purchase however for every rank below soldier is to the wearable armor they would like to purchase the premium increases by for example bannerman purchases rare item of armor in their rank this costs them eth or vemp equivalent member of the legion can also purchase this same armor however this will cost them eth or vemp equivalent this stacks the higher somebody tries to buy outside of their rank in the spirit of fair game and equality among all as mentioned in section the empire is ddao and so democracy rules free monetary limitations are only enforced where bots that would do us harm could influence and corrupt our new democratic society equal voting system the empire rewards loyalty above all and loyalty will never just come from those with money the empire is built by the people for the people and so we will hear applications for increases in rank from any soldier who believes they have been loyal contributed to the success of the empire no matter whether that contribution was up to specified monetary level or not card proof of concept romulus troops remus troops name strength class ability name strength class ability barbarians light soldier wild animals remove strength from

bulldogs with cybernetic powers eventually they succeeded and created three prototypes one that could fart atomic gases one that released nasty powerful burps and one that could make the walls shake with its daytime snoring they named them fartoid burpoid and snoroid these original bulldroids developing higher intelligence from the crazed scientists experiments soon understood that they were the butt of some sick joke they also understood that revenge is dish best served coldin dog bowlpreferably with some peanut butter so they continued to act as expected like good little doggies however

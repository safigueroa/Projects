Rebel Bots - Xoil Wars is a cross platform card battle game, players will be able to play, progress and earn in a single player or multiplayer sci-fi themed game taking place in outer space. The game will require players to unite around extra-terrestrial kingdoms, build their army of fighting robots and compete with other players for the valuable Xoil resource. introduction Our vision is to create a leading game franchise within the blockchain games space by building the Rebel Bots brand with several gaming titles. Players will be able to use the characters they own in all the games within the Rebel Bots universe. Among our goals is to create true social games which enable players to join forces with other players, play both casual and competitive gameplay. vision - Use gameplay mechanics known to millions of players - Create simple FTUE (First Time User Experience) for non-NFT players - Launch the game with the help of thousands of Robot owners - Create a sustainable Play-to-Earn economy - Build the Rebel Bots universe in which players can play their characters in multiple games strategy game design goals 04 In the initial design process of the game we’ve marked these aspects as key to make our Play-to-Earn game successful: 1. Skill based game: in order for the game to be competitive and allow the true dedicated gamers to earn from playing it, the game will have to be primarily skill based, with almost zero randomness and little to no luck involved in the gameplay. In addition, we wanted players to compete in more than one kind of tournament, allowing players which aren’t ranked at the very top to still have a chance of winning a tournament. We prioritize skill over payto-win. 2. Social gameplay: the success of social games comes from the need to both socialize with other players but also from the joy of working together to win and complete achievements. Social gaming creates better virality, improved retention, higher engagement rates and most importantly organic growth. 3. High production quality: the main reason users are currently attracted to the Play to Earn niche, is due to the possibility of earning income/revenue while playing a game. We want them to feel good about the game itself regardless of earning money. This is why we are designing every aspect in the game, from art design through to the backstory of characters, and ensuring game stability and a smooth experience, so we can deliver the highest production level possible for players. 4. Simple yet sustainable play-to-earn model: generating revenue from playing the game is important but creating a simple mechanism for players who prefer to engage with the game on a different level and still earn from it is equally important for building a user base of non-playing users from the broader crypto community. The long term token value will come from introducing new features which will drive the Rebel Bots game universe forward. 5. Must be fun: there is a tendency to see Play-to-earn games as a job rather than an actual game, we intend to change that by combining proven fun driven features from the social games space. backstory and lore 05 The year is 2052, it’s three years after the “Big Dismantle” event which saw millions of robots being scraped to pieces and their core destroyed by the humans who feared robots were about to revolt against them. Only 10,000 were lucky enough to escape this fate. In order to survive they formed the robot resistance, which has only one goal, to rebuild the robot factory so they can manufacture their brothers and sisters again. The resistance is the robots last remaining hope. After many attempts to make their plan work, the robots were backed into a corner, they had no other choice but to flee Earth to an unknown fate in outer space. They have travelled space for years and due to low supply of oil they had no other choice but to land on a deserted planet named “Xoilium”, which is a unique planet with different habitats but with no known population and naturally no industrial capabilities or oil. Life in Xoilium became harder, searches for Oil proved successful as the robots found small amounts of Xoil (Extra terrestrial Oil) but the supply was scarce, and the robots discovered there are other native inhabitants living in Xoilium who also harvest the Xoil for their own needs. Resources become scarce, and so the Rebel Bots eventually turn against each other by closing themselves in isolated kingdoms, declare war against each other and must battle for every drop of Xoil. Read the full Rebel Bots backstory here to find out how the resistance was formed and what drove them looking for a new home on Xoilium - https://rebel-bots.medium.com/ kingdoms 06 The Rebel Bots game consists of thousands of different kingdoms, each kingdom was built by one of the original, generation 1 Rebel Bots and its lands are protected by their powers. Like the Rebel Bots, not all Kingdoms are equal - Robots with rarer traits were able to capture themselves larger kingdoms with bigger lands. In order to continue protecting their kingdoms the Rebel Bots divided their lands into smaller lands equal in size, these lands are offered to players who are willing to protect their lord’s kingdom in exchange for the grant to pump Xoil of the kingdom’s soil, use special kingdom powers and compete for the Kingdom’s treasure every season. kingdoms 07 The Kingdom Lords are the Generation 1 (Genesis) Rebel Bots from the Rebel Bots collection, this is the most valuable NFT in the game as each Rebel Bot is a Kingdom Lord. The game will start with 10,000 different Kingdoms and Kingdom Lords. The Kingdom lord is not a playable character, the Rebel Bot avatar will be used as the kingdom’s banner and every player who will join the game will fight under a certain Kingdom banner. The precious land resource will be allocated to each kingdom according to the rarity rank of the Rebel Bot ruling the kingdom, the Rebel Bots owners will receive a revenue share from every land sold in their kingdom both in the initial land sale and in any secondary sale, revenue share percentage is also determined by the rarity rank of the Rebel Bot as can be seen in the table below: Kingdom lords RB Rarity min RB Rarity max No.of landsin kingdom Total lands in tier Revenue share 1 50 26 1,300 50% 51 100 25 1,250 45% 101 250 23 3,450 40% 251 500 22 5,500 35% 501 1,000 21 10,500 30% 1,001 2,000 19 19,000 25% 2,001 3,000 18 18,000 20% 3,001 4,000 16 16,000 15% 4,001 5,000 15 15,000 10% 5,001 6,000 14 14,000 8% 6,001 7,000 13 13,000 6% 7,001 8,000 12 12,000 4% 8,001 9,000 11 11,000 2% 9,001 10,000 10 10,000 1% kingdoms 08 Kingdom Lords are able to generate additional income from royalties received from the Kingdom players (aka Land Owners) as they use their kingdom land to produce Xoil. Of every Xoil produced in Adventure mode players will share a 4% royalty to their kingdom lord and a 6% royalty to the kingdom’s treasury, treasury will be used as a prize-pool for the Kingdom’s top ranked players at the end of every season. It is up to the kingdom lord to lead his kingdom to victories against other kingdoms by voting each month on the Kingdom card, incentivizing his kingdom players and more. If the Kingdom lord fails to perform the actions required from him as the ruler of the kingdom his royalties from the specific month will be transferred to the Kingdom’s treasury. In addition to the kingdom’s treasury the game will allocate additional prizes to kingdoms which have the most engaged players within the game’s social media channels. kingdoms 09 Lands are the game’s second most valuable NFT, without land players aren’t able to play. Lands are initially sold directly to players on the game’s website while secondary land sales will be done on the game’s internal marketplace. Each land is located in a different habitat and has various buildings: 1. Headquarters - Communicate with other Kingdom players 2. Fighting Bots Barracks - Train your fighting bot team 3. Fighting Bots Factory - Build new fighting bot and store parts 4. Xoil Silo - Purify and Store Xoil 5. Spark Capacitor - Store Spark 6. Parts shop - Buy and trade parts 7. Intel Command - Get updates about the game Game will be launched with 150,000 lands which will be allocated as follows: - 130,000 lands will be sold to players during the game big land sale - 10,000 lands will be given to each Rebel bot owner in his own kingdom - 10,000 lands will be used for marketing purposes Prior to game launch each land will be sold or given with a set of 3 fighting bots allowing players to start battling from their first session in the game and thus offering a simple onboarding process. Kingdom lands kingdoms 10 After all 130,000 lands were sold the game will issue new 10,000 generation 2 Rebel Bots, generation 2 Rebel Bots will be issued together with lands associated to them to allow more players to enter the game, Once a new generation of Rebel Bots is created the former generation land capacity will be doubled as can be seen in this table below: Players can own multiple lands but can only play in one land at any given time, if player chooses he can rent these lands he is not playing in for new players who want to enter the game at a lower cost. Lands Generation 1 Generation 2 Generation 3 Generation 4 Total Lands in Game New lands 150,000 0 0 0 150,000 New lands 300,000 150,000 0 0 450,000 New lands 600,000 300,000 150,000 0 1,050,000 New lands 1,200,000 600,000 300,000 150,000 2,250,000 New lands 2,400,000 1,200,000 600,000 300,000 4,500,000 kingdoms 11 Every player in the game is part of a kingdom, Players can choose to which kingdom they would like to join by acquiring a land in that specific kingdom. Players can participate in all game modes, tournaments and events. In order to start playing Players will need to build their initial fighting robot army, the minimum amount for entering battles, both adventure and PvP is 3 fighting robots. The amount of fighting bots player holds in his base will determine the amount of energy he has, as can be seen in the table below: kingdom players Robots owned min Robots owned max Max Energy 3 9 20 10 24 40 25 50 60 Energy allows players to play in reward based PvP battles and is recharged to the maximum level on a daily basis. The game is built to allow both competitive and casual players to earn from playing. fighting bots 12 This is the 3rd and most common NFT in the game, unlike Rebel Bots and Lands the Fighting Bots have is not capped at a certain number, building and minting Fighting Bots is one of the ways to earn from playing the game. Players will need to build and assemble a balanced team of fighting bots in order to succeed in battles and progress in the game. Battles are held between 2 sides, each has 3 Fighting bots, these robots are used by Kingdom players to win battles, gain game resources and increase the player’s MMR (Matchmaking Rating). Each Fighting Bot is made from 5 different parts: - Head - Torso - Left Arm - Right Arm - Legs Each part represents a different card and ability for the player to use in the battlefield, the head is the most important part as it will also determine the Fighting Bot robot class. Parts have different rarity that will determine the strength of the card in the battlefield and its cost. Once built, players will not be able to change the robot parts. fighting bots 13 The Fighting Robots can be built in 3 different Classes, and Class is determined by the robot head. Building a “pure” Fight Robot, meaning that all parts are from the same class - this will grant the Fighting Robot improved abilities. Each Class has 3 sub-classes: - Military Bots - Offense units, high DPS - Industrial Bots - Defense units, can absorb more damage - Engineer Bots - Support unit, repairs and increases stats of other units The 3 Classes have a Rock-Paper-Scissors Relationship in Combat, providing Bonuses and Handicaps relative to each other. Each Fighting bot will have 2 constant parameter and one dynamic parameter: - Hit Points (Constant) - Speed (Constant) - Morale (Dynamic) classes and stats fighting bots 14 Morale varies between 1 and 5 is determined by the amount of wins-in-arow player has and can increase both other parameters of all of the player’s Fighting Bots. In addition each Fighting Bot will have a special skill installed in it when built, skills are stat or card effect modifiers. Fighting bots can be either bought on the marketplace or built using the game resources, building a large enough army of Fighting bots will increase the player’s ability to store more resources as can be seen in the table: Robots owned min Robots owned max Max Spark Max Parts Max Xoil 3 9 200 15 5,000 10 24 400 30 7,500 25 50 600 45 10,000 More classes will be introduced to the game on a regular basis. fighting bots 15 Battles are done with cards, each player enters the battle with 3 robots when each represents 5 cards, in battles each card amount is doubled making a deck of 30 cards per each player. Cards are presented in the game by the Fighting Bot parts and have the following parameter in them: - Class - Rarity - Battery cost - Damage - Armor - Special ability (if card is rare) cards and rarity Choosing the right combination of cards when forming the Fighting Bots crew is crucial for winning battles. The class of the robot will add a bonus to the same class specific cards and having a “pure” Fighting Bot will increase the abilities as well. Rare cards offer higher damage, more armor and a special ability, Cards have 4 different rarities: - Common - Rare - Epic - Legendary Every season new cards will be added to the game. fighting bots 16 Building Fighting Bots is the most exciting part of the game, players will get to use the resources they earn from battles to build their perfect combination of Fighters. The Fighting Bots players are minted on the blockchain and become an asset they hold. Fighting Bots manufacturing takes time and at any given time only one new robot can be built in the factory. In order to build a fighting robot, players will need the following resources: - 5 different parts - Head, Torso, Left and Right Arms and Legs - Spark - Xoil - RBLS coin building fighting bots fighting bots 17 The amount of resources each bot costs to build changes according to the amount of bots the factory has built during a season, the cost will reset once a new season has started allowing players to mint more Fighting bots for less resources. Gathering parts and spark will require players to participate in PvP battles while earning Xoil can be done both in PvP and Adventure modes. Getting parts in a battle works in a unique way, players will be able to earn a part which a robot on the losing opponent team has, making the battles more exciting. Each part has a card attached to it and therefore players will know what ability to expect when building their fighting robot, however rarity together with the special Fighting bot ability are determined randomly after the building process is completed. gameplay 18 The goal of the game is to create a fun and fast skill based game. It will be the type of game which takes “30 minutes to learn and lifetime to master”. Players will be able to play it both in single player mode (adventure) and in multiplayer mode (PvP). The core gameplay is a turn-based semi automatic card battle. It is based on the successful gameplay mechanics created by games such as Hearthstone, Magic The Gathering (built for the more hardcore players), and games such as Clash Royale (built for the casual mobile gamers). Like the above mentioned games, the Rebel Bots game will also be conducted between two sides, each with their own cards and abilities battling to destroy the other side’s characters by choosing which cards to play and how to play them in order to achieve the upper hand in the battlefield. Not all cards are equal, some cards are more rare than others and therefore more powerful, however they will require the player to exhaust more energy to use them. In addition to the cards in their hand, players will also be granted a special ability he can use in battles that comes from the kingdom he/she is situated in. Apart from the battles, players will invest their time collecting and building the best and most balanced “decks” of cards which will give them the edge in battles. Creating the right deck of cards will require players to spend time learning the different abilities and types of cards. gameplay 19 The adventure mode is the single player mode in the Rebel Bots game. Players will be able to progress in this mode between various levels, each level will reward players with Xoil if they complete it. In the adventure mode, players travel between various habitats on Xoilium with the goal to complete missions and clear locations of hostile aliens which drink the Xoil from the planet’s soil only to use it later for malicious attacks against bases. Playing the adventure mode doesn’t cost any energy to play, however there is a limit to the amount of Xoil players can earn per day by playing the adventure mode. The amount of Xoil in each mission varies and divided into 3 different amounts, players will need to complete the mission 3 times to gather the full amount of Xoil, every mission will have a different difficulty level. In the adventure mode From every Xoil players earn, a portion will be given to the kingdom lord and another portion will be added to the kingdom treasury. In the beginning of every season the missions will be changed and players will be able to continue playing the maps and earn more Xoil. adventure mode (PvE) gameplay 20 The player vs player mode (PvP) is a multiplayer game mode allowing players to battle their Fighting bot team against other players’ teams. PvP is also the main way for players to earn Xoil, Spark and collect parts. Players are matched together based on their MMR, players with similar MMR will be matched against one another and the result of the battle will determine the amount of MMR each player will gain or lose. In addition the higher the MMR difference between the players. Playing PvP costs one energy per battle, when the player has no energy left he can still continue to play the PvP mode however he will only be able to gain MMR and not the other resources. The Xoil and Spark rewards from winning PvP battles are based on the MMR and league player is in while the chance of getting a new part is random. Multiplayer Mode (PvP) MMR - Matchmaking Rating The players match rating is represented in the game by trophies, Each Player is represented in the game by the amount of MMR he has, this determines his rank in the game leaderboards. MMR is won or lost depending on the outcome of PvP Battles, the rank of the opposing player will determine the amount of MMR added or subtracted. Every new season players will start from the initial MMR of the league they have played in when the season ended and they’ll need to work their way up to the top of the leaderboards. gameplay 21 Leagues League Min MMR Max MMR League 1 0 299 League 2 300 599 League 3 600 999 League 4 1000 1499 League 5 1499 1999 League 6 2000 2749 League 7 2750 3499 League 8 3500 5000 IIn PvP players will progress through different leagues according to their MMR, the top leagues hold special prizes in the form of Xoil and RBLS. The bottom league where all players start their journey from is the only league that doesn’t generate rewards to players who win matches. Leagues structure: As the game will evolve more leagues will be added according to players progress. gameplay 22 The gameplay is a semi-automatic card battle game, players will choose which cards they’d like their robots to play and the robots will perform the card action in their turn, this will go on until one side is victorious. gameplay mechanics Location Battles take place in one of the player’s original kingdom habitats, the kingdom habitat will show in the background of the battlefield. Kingdom Card Each player will start the match with a kingdom card which was chosen by his kingdom players for the duration of the season. The kingdom card can only be played once per match. Kingdom cards work exactly like other cards as they cost battery to use and can cause damage, increase armor and hit points of fighting bots or use a special ability on the battlefield. gameplay 23 Battle flow Each battle will start with showing each player’s robots and place them in their battle formation. After that, the following game phases will begin: - Preview - showing each 10 cards of each player’s card deck while keeping 5 cards hidden - Rounds - a limited time phase in which each player can choose which cards or special abilities to play - Outcome - End of battle and determination of winner with the prizes shown. Battle is completed when one of the players has no more robots left on the battlefield. gameplay 24 The game has 2 crypto currencies and 3 game currencies: currencies and resources Name Type Limited Source Sink Xoil Crypto/In-game No - Winning PvE matches - Winning PvP matches - Completing daily challenges - Winning Kingdom prizes - Buying parts - Minting Fighting bots RBLS Crypto/Governance Yes - Winning Season prizes - Special Giveaways - Minting Fighting bots - Purchasing Lands Energy Game resource No - Replenish - Playing PvP matches Spark Game resource No - Winning PvP matches - Completing daily challenges - Minting Fighting bots Parts Game resource No - Winning PvP matches - Buying from in-game shop - Minting Fighting bots - Rusting gameplay 25 The Rebel Bots game has 3 different leaderboards for the players to compete in. Each leaderboard attracts different types of players and rewards the winners in a different way thus creating a way for every type of player to have a chance to win big prizes by ranking high in one of the leaderboards. Leaderboards are reset at the beginning of every season and have a countdown until winners will be announced. Prizes for each leaderboard are known in advance or have a counter to show them as they gain more currency for the prize-pool. Leaderboard types: - Worldwide players leaderboard - shows all players ranked by their MMR. The top ranked players at the top league at the end of the season will win prizes in the form of RBLS tokens. - Kingdoms Leaderboard - shows all kingdoms ranked by the cumulative amount of their top 10 players’ MMR. The top kingdoms at the end of the season will win prizes in the form of RBLS tokens which will be distributed to the top 10 players in the winning kingdom. - Internal Kingdom Leaderboard - shows all the kingdom players ranked by the amount of battles they’ve won during the season. The top 3 players will win the Xoil prize-pool gathered from the allocation all players made from adventure mode during the season. leaderboards and season prizes team & investors 26 Rebel Bots Xoil Wars core team are gaming veterans with over 10 years each in the social gaming industry.

These tokens are a premium in-game currency given to players for free for certain gameplay actions in the Rebel Bots game. The RBLS tokens are tradeable between players on exchanges and will be distributed to players over time. In addition, they may be distributed to community members for certain actions as deemed appropriate by the dev team under a reward program, for example, participation in community events, grants, bonus tokens, competitions and more.

The team’s vision is to keep on growing the community on Twitter, Discord and other social platforms so when the game will be released there will be a pool of potential players ready to start playing. In addition, The 10,000 Rebel Bots collection is owned by over 2.5K unique owners, the team sees each of these owners a champion of the game who will drive hype and awareness to the game. Our community already proved to be super efficient at creating marketing content, driving growth and bringing new future players to our social channels. As we get closer to the release, we aim to give each and every Rebel Bot owner unique ways for him to gather his personal kingdom players. The next phase is to turn the Rebel Bots game into a complete community owned DAO, we aim to do that through our governance token, RBLS. This process is expected to happen as RBLS is distributed among RB owners and players with the dev team and seed investors ownership becoming less concentrated over time. The dev team will be able to vote with the locked Play to Earn and Staking rewards allocations. This will prevent hostile actors from disrupting the ecosystem during the early and crucial phases of development. We estimate that the dev team will no longer have the Majority vote by Q4 2023. rebel bots dao technology 33 The Rebel Bots Xoil Wars game is developed for both mobile devices and PC Installable clients with a smooth cross-platform game experience.

Those tokens are issued for the Rebel Bots game but not strictly for that. The RBLS and XOIL tokens are issued on the Polygon network, further information can be found here . https://polygon.technology We have chosen Polygon to accommodate the business and community aspects of it as much as the technology. The requirements for the blockchain network are (not necessarily by priority): - Decentralized and secure: the blockchain network should be decentralized and secure to cancel the risk of it being compromised. The infrastructure should be immune to 51% attacks and other vulnerabilities. - EVM Blockchain compatibility: Supporting ERC-20 and ERC-721 To comply with solidity, cross chain bridge, open source for mobility. - Popularity: Polygon network is one of the top gaming adopted blockchains. Most of the blockchain users/gamers hold matic, Polygon’s native token, in their wallets. It is used in the Rebel Bots game for gas fees on minting and cross chain transfers. smart contract audit Token minting smart contracts have passed an audit by Certic, an external auditor.

Facilitating a paradigm shift from the increasingly curated and exhaustive experience that comes with navigating the various web2 social media platforms to an immersive digital experience where users interact creating relationships while also benefiting economically; transforming the way we play, earn, and live. In this nascent industry, imagination is the only limitation to what can be achieved within our digital world of endless possibility.  Andrometa Metavers A User Owned and Operated Digital Economy Andrometa is virtual world (MMO RPG) developed on Unreal Engine 5, made up of a culmination of different planets, geographical environments and cities that enables users to own, build, create and monetize their digital experience on our custom 'Malaia Sidechain' using Andrometa $SHRDS, our platform's utility token.  Andrometa offers a unique experience to our users by giving them the ability to purchase tokenized land plots that owners can repurpose and monetize to earn $SHRDS from their digital efforts. The land plots are represented by non-fungible tokens that can be bought, sold, traded, rented etc. Expansive MMORPG environmental game play will come out in phases as more and more regions of Andrometa are developed and released. MNNT is developing a true player owned and operated economy where players may earn not only by exploration and game play, but also through content creation and adding value into the metaverse. This type of business model, empowers the creativity of our users, as Andrometa will continue to grow as more user generated content is created.  MNNT Ltd. envisions a brand new and unique digital experience where users have the ability to become hunters, gatherers, forge masters, tavern owners, farmers, merchants, messengers, warriors, guild owners monster hunter and so on. All the while earning real economic value from their inter-metaverse professional pursuits, completely separate from the real world economy.  Brand Opportunities Dawn of the Digital Fashion Era The commercial applications of the metaverse have been strengthened by new societal behaviors surging around buying products and services directly from social experiences, known as “social commerce.” Social commerce is becoming a larger percentage of U.S. e-commerce over time and was projected to be $36 billion in 2021 alone, similar to china.  Utilizing the metaverse to create virtual showrooms, fashion shows, or dressing rooms, brands can capitalize on the intersection of metaverse technology and social commerce to reach new consumers without traditional global restrictions. Brands, designers and artists will have the ability to create entirely new and imaginative wearable lines or decorative assets in the form of NFTs; bought and sold free of gas on our Malaia sidechain. These NFT items/wearables can be purchased and equipped by users within Andrometa. Ushering in a future where brands and designers can release countless new lines of digital asset wearables without worrying about the logistics of overhead costs, shipping, storage, sourcing of materials etc. Andrometa offers a totally new experience as NFTs continue to immerse individuals in the digital world. As more people adopt NFT technology, digital goods will become its own asset class distinguishing itself as the digital services industry has over the last decade.  We are at the precipice of a new digital age where digital interaction will begin to rival in person interaction. A future where people can choose to be represented publicly by their NFTs. We see this already with countless celebrities representing their social media accounts with NFT PFPs, brands buying digital land in the metaverse and individuals making complete brands out of the NFTs they own. Major retailers such as Nike, McDonalds, Victoria Secret, Gucci, Adidas and more have already began exploring digita related patents in preparation for this metaverse paradigm swiftly approaching. MNNT Ltd. recognizes these trends and we believe they will only accelerate as time goes on and the technology behind digital immersion and the Web3 revolution continues to improve.  Play-To-Earn THREE SEPARATE PLAY TO EARN GAMES Imagine becoming the biggest employer supplying countless jobs in various countries all over the world without actually having any real employees. That is what the future of work may look like with the emergence of the 'Play-To-Earn' game model.  Until now, earning a real income through gaming has been explicitly limited. Unless someone was a popular streamer with the capability of securing sponsorship deals, running ads on stream or winning big money tournaments, your ability to earn through gaming was next to naught.  NFTs are quickly transforming the world and gamified metaverse applications are leading the way in this nascent industry. The traditional gaming models have continued to exploit gamers through free to play games where every day players spend time and money to buy items in-game, but receive no value added for their time or contributions in game. For instance, if a player stops playing a game, all the money and time spent on items, upgrading their players or maxing out their skills in game become worthless. If the game is shut down for any reason, such as a decline in popularity that makes it less profitable, all the player’s in-game purchases vanish as if they never existed and all the players are effectively stripped of all the value they contributed up until this point.  This traditional single profit gaming model is outdated. Years of development have contributed to the relatively fixed gameplay in the game industry where most games are purely virtual, and companies cannot combine the information content in the game with real life, which makes the game and real life in a relatively separated state. This has resulted in a monotonous profit model where companies only make profits by selling the content of the game itself (game itself, DLC, game internal props, etc.), and cannot expand more profit channels. MNNT Ltd. reimagines this through the idea of play-to-earn gaming. Using the power of blockchain technology, MNNT Ltd. will empower its users, making the terms ""play"" and ""earn"" synonymous with one another.  Within our play-to-earn games players can earn by:  Completing missions. Winning battles. Completing quests. Generating value add content.  Loaning or renting out in game items. Offering goods or services to other users.  Competing in tournaments.  Defi applicaiton of Andrometa $SHRDS  Meta Smash Fighters Battle it Out In Close Combat The first of these three games to be released in 2022 is a Meta Smash Fighters a full fighting style game where NFT owners can battle their NFTs against each other in hand-to-hand combat to earn economic rewards, bragging rights and above all else, glory. Through a hybrid mix of 2D and 3D animated iterations, users will battle against each other with special moves, fighting combinations with eye-catching artistic styles that stay true to the underlying anime inspirations.  Inspired by games such as Super Smash Bros,' that brings a multitude of gaming universes together under one umbrella, MNNT Ltd. aims to work collaboratively with other NFT communities allowing those communities the ability to access this fighting game as well through the Variant Creation System discussed in a later section. This will allow NFTs from one community to battle NFTs in another community creating a truly inclusive NFT gaming experience. NFT enthusiasts, gamers and holders alike will no longer need to argue over which community or NFT is better as they can simply settle their disputes in the battle arena where to the victor goes the spoils ($SHRDS) and community bragging rights. Meta Royale Survival of the Fittest MNNT Ltd.'s second play-to-earn game to be released will be in the form of a battle royale style game. Users will have to utilize their NFTs skills in various environmental arenas to be the last one standing in this ultimate showdown of NFTs. More details to come in Q4 of 2022.  Meta Conquerors Prepare Your Troops! Our third game expected to release is a strategy game that can be compared to games like 'Fire Emblem' or 'Into the breach', but on a multiplayer scale. The NFT owner's will be able to fight each other on a large grid with a variety of different abilities giving them a lot of room to outplay their opponents and earn rewards for their skill, not only their time spent in-game. This strategy game requires a team roster of NFTs in order to play. More details to come in Q3 of 2022. Missions Restricted to the We Are the Outkast Genesis Collection Mechanics  Missions are a strategic thought invoking basic strategy game that allows 'We Are the Outkast' NFT holders to immerse themselves into the lore of our anime universe. Outkast NFTs can be deployed in max teams of 4 on these missions of varying length in order to generate ERC-20 tokens known as Shards ($SHRDS) for the Outkast NFT owners as well as experience points that go toward leveling up the deployed Outkast NFTs. Each mission is designed to yield around 125,000 $SHRDS over the mission period. The missions are broken up into different pools where the amount of Outkast NFTs deployed in the mission pool will impact the amount of $SHRDS earned per deployed squad. 125,000 possible $SHRDS to be earned equates to 0.1 $SHRDS earned per second. These 0.1 $SHRDS earned per second are split amongst all Outkast NFTs deployed in that specific mission.  (Example - If only 1 Outkast NFT is deployed and participating in a mission, this Outkast NFT would earn that full Shard. However, once other Outkast NFTs are deployed on this same mission, the Shard distribution is then split between them all in accordance with the power ratings of each deployed squad.) What is Power? Power is the strength an individual Outkast NFT or squad of Outkast NFTs have going into a mission. Power directly relates to the efficiency of the Outkast NFTs deployed within the mission to yield shards and experience points (XP). Every mission comes with a unique piece of lore allowing the participants to immerse themselves into the lore of the anime story while playing a game.  As with anything in life, certain individual Outkast NFTs are better suited for different missions based on the attached lore and their own characteristics and traits. In other words, Outkast NFTs that possess traits or characteristics that align with the coinciding mission lore will receive what is called a 'Mission Power Boost' allowing them to earn a better yield of $SHRDS and XP. For example if a mission requires stealth, individual Outkast NFTs that have tactical equipment would receive a power boost. Or if instead the mission happened in the dead of night, individual Outkast NFTs that have night vision goggles may receive a power boost and so on. This requires planning and strategy on the part of the NFT owners since they must try to select the best line up of Outkast NFTs to deploy for that specific mission in order to maximize their $SHRDS and XP yield received. Rarity of the trait also plays a part with the amount of Power Boost an item can generate. The more rare the trait or item (comparatively speaking), the greater the boost. For example - the ‘Corroded Rifle’ is one of the most common weapons/traits in the collection, therefore the boost received from this item is minimal. However, a rare item such as the ‘Fire Weaver Sword’ will receive a much greater boost. (Think traditional video game mechanics, where legendary weapons are more powerful and have better stats than their common counterparts). How is Power Calculated? The mission lore will explain which traits and weaponry provide boosts for that specific mission. Now imagine a team of Outkast NFTs are the first ones deployed to a specific mission. The team of Outkast NFTs have a total power of 10 based on their traits and characteristics making the total deployed power within the mission 10. This deployed team now receives 10/10 of the total power, giving the team owner 0.1 Shards every second. 10 minutes later (600 seconds) this team has generated a total of 60 $SHRDS.  At this point, another Outkast team is deployed in the same mission with a power level of 5. Now the total deployed power within the mission is at 15. The new squad deployed now earns 33.3% (.033 Shards per second) of the yield generated in the mission pool, and the first squad earns 66.6% of the yield (.066 Shards per second). Keep in mind that this example was just a simple example split between two teams.  (NOTE: Real missions have many more participants and multiple teams of four, so the calculations and strategy become much more intricate and earnings per squad won’t be as high as they were in the simple example.) Level Up Your NFT NFT collections released by MNNT Ltd. have a unique utility not seen in the majority of projects. The ability to level up the NFT over time as is seen in video games and anime series throughout history. Leveling up your NFTs will produce greater rarity, access to better fusions, the ability to wield rare or legendary weapons and yield the NFT owner more $SHRDS on missions. NFT owners can level up their NFTs by accumulating experience points (XP) through using/interacting within Andrometa, completing missions and playing the play-to-earn games. This means the rarity of the MNNT Ltd. NFT collections is always fluctuating as owners continue to earn XP by interacting with our platform and play to earn games. Fusion How does fusion work? NOTE: Please be aware the fusion will only be available until 5000 Outkast NFTs remain.  Mechanic Fusion is a system that allows the owner of two (2) Outkast NFTs to combine (fuse) two (2) Outkast NFTs together, in order to create a brand new Outkast NFT; mixing and matching the traits of the original two. In the process, one (1) of the two (2) Outkast NFTs used for fusion are burned, making the collection deflationary over time. The collection will continue to reduce in size until only 5000 Outkast NFTs remain. The cost of fusion starts at 1000 $SHRDS. This allows the fuser to lock any five (5) traits, giving the fuser some control over the randomness of the fusion. If a fuser chooses to lock more than 5 traits, each additional trait will increase the cost of fusion by 100 $SHRDS. (This base price to fuse will increase as more Outkast NFTs are fused). Users can check the various fusion combinations using the 'Fusion Change Generator' on our website. This allows users to preview their fusions prior to fusing.  All of the collections released by MNNT will have these fusion capabilities. Fusions provide a gamified ownership sequence which enables users to select NFTs they may not ordinarily buy, to use for fusion purposes. This allows our collections to remain deflationary naturally shocking the supply through this organically built in fusion utility. Trait Combos Outkast NFTs can be fused together to create entirely new NFTs. Additionally, the traits seen within the We Are the Outkast NFT collection can also be combined (fused) together to create entirely different and sometimes brand new (rare) traits and/or items not available within the original collection. Your new trait will hence be incredibly rare until others discover the combo. This includes traits that had a low rarity score to begin with. It is important to keep in mind that some of the rarer trait combo's are locked behind a level requirement. As with any game, often times a player needs to have a certain level of skill to wield certain armors and artifacts; the same can be said for the Outkast NFTs.  Level Bonuses Fusing two (2) Outkast NFTs allows the new creation to reach new heights sooner than base Outkast NFTs. During fusion, instead of adding experience points together, their levels are combined giving them a major boost. As discussed in the Missions Section, higher level Outkast’s have more power, which will normally yield more $SHRDS. LvL 3 Outkast NFT (2100 XP) + LvL 10 Outkast NFT (13581 XP) = LvL 13 Outkast NFT (21386 XP) *NOT LvL 10 Outkast NFT (15681) Variant Creation System The MNNT Ltd. NFT collections provide robust utility for holders of these original collections by allowing holders the ability create ""Variants"" of their NFTs. A 'Variant' is essentially an authorized derivative NFT made from the original MNNT Ltd. NFT collections. Owners of the MNNT Ltd. collections will have the ability to create brand new NFT Variants from the MNNT Ltd. original collections. Holders can create these variants as many times as they wish (albeit with increasing $SHRDS cost). The variant itself becomes a brand new NFT that holders can then choose to sell/rent to others to join up, however, what you want to do with these additional NFTs will be up to you.  Variants can be used in the MNNT Ltd. play-to-earn games as well as to access the Andrometa metaverse MMORPG. However, holders will not be able to create a variant from a variant. The 'Variant Creation System' enables a wide array of opportunities and vastly expands the user base of the MNNT Ltd. games and Andrometa metaverse. Further, it adds value to the original MNNT Ltd NFT collections, since holders can make as many variants as they want to lend, sell or trade.  Variant Creation Opportunities Fostering New Opportunities within Andrometa Andrometa offers a completely unique digital experience to its users. The 'Variant Creation System' provides opportunities for artists and creatives all around the world.  Users can purchase from MNNT Ltd. Varianeticist (Variant + Geneticist) licenses. These licenses give their holders the power to create variants in exchange for $SHRDS. MNNT Ltd. aims to foster artistic creativity and allow artists to build their brands, promote their works and make real income within our metaverse by creating these new variant artworks in exchange for $SHRDS. As Andrometa and our user base grows, more artists and creatives will be attracted to our metaverse so that they can begin earning $SHRDS for their services and growing their reputations individually as artists amongst our users. The better the artist the more users will hire them to create their variant NFTs. Aligning with our economic value of user generated content consistently expanding the Andrometa metaverse.  MNNT Ltd. will need to approve the variant creation as the artwork and style will need to fit in with the style of the Andrometa and play-to-earn games themselves.  Uniting NFT Communities Together We All Can Make It Through the last several years, the NFT space has grown exponentially. Truly hitting its stride in 2021, with an explosion of new and unique projects. As NFTs increase in popularity and use cases, many artists, project founders, and communities compete for relevancy amongst the big names and hyped projects. This is normally done through providing utility attached to ownership of the NFT itself. However, not every artist is a developer and surfing the many unsold projects on the secondary market illustrates the difficulty of distinguishing one project from another.  MNNT Ltd. recognizes this fierce competition among NFT artists and communities alike. In order to begin unifying the NFT space, MNNT Ltd. plans to selectively partner with various NFT projects and communities to provide additional utility to their projects and ultimately their communities. Through these partnerships, MNNT Ltd. will provide these communities and their respective NFTs access to Andrometa as well as to our play-to-earn games using the aforementioned 'Variant Creation System'. With this system, MNNT Ltd. imagine a truly unified NFT space all within one metaverse, Andrometa.  The Real and Digital Merch Stores A Store for the Real World and the Metaverse. MNNT Ltd. offers a unique experience for its collection holders both within Andrometa and in real life. MNNT Ltd. gives its users a unique experience by offering the ability to purchase real life merchandise customized with their own unique 1:1 NFTs. This means that NFT owners can purchase merchandise customized with their own NFTs, allowing them the opportunity to flaunt their NFTs anywhere they go.  Additionally, MNNT Ltd. offers an exclusive merchandise store made specifically for your NFTs within our games and metaverse. MNNT Ltd. will be releasing a merchandise store where holders can use $SHRDS to purchase traits, items and NFT assets that can be applied to their NFTs. Depending on what collections you hold, these items can be used for fusion and the creation of legendary traits and weapons. Creating this store allows holders to completely customize their NFTs any way they desire. Andrometa's marketplace creates endless possibilities for different brands and designers to create entirely new collections within the digital space. Where designers can create real NFT fashion assets that can be applied to NFTs on the Malaia chain. When the NFT itself is sold, the digital clothing assets stay with the original holder unless those NFTs are also included in the sale. MNNT Ltd. imagines designer brands designing not only traditional merchandise such as jackets and sneakers for these NFTs but also completely new collections such as a designer armor series, capes, face masks and so on. This opens a new world of opportunities for brands to establish themselves within Andrometa and expose their brands to a new global client base. Creating entirely new fashion lines specifically designed to be bought and sold within the Andrometa. The possibilities are truly limited only by ones own imagination. $SHRDS $SHRDS are an ERC-20 utility token that powers the inter-metaverse economy within Andrometa. $SHRDS have a wide array of uses such as: of MNNT Ltd. NFT CollectionsTransfer of new NFTs and Variants into AndrometaVariant creationPurchase of new MNNT Ltd. NFT collections, land, and digital assetsInteractions amongst users within AndrometaSuch as paying for a variety of goods and servicesBuying and selling land within the Metaverse Renting NFT items Playing Ranked Matches amongst our play-to-earn NFT games Interactive participation in Outkast NFT related mangas and animes. There are multiple ways to earn $SHRDS, the most efficient way is to own an Outkast NFT and send them on a mission. The second way is to add liquidity to any of our pools on the Malaia chain. Finally, MNNT Ltd. will be hosting regular tournaments in our metaverse allowing the most elite and skillful players to battle it out and earn this premium currency. Tokenomics $SHRDS are a deflationary token that find their naming inspirations from the anime lore. $SHRDS will be distributed to holders of the 'We Are the Outkast' NFT collection through the mission mechanic, as well as to anyone providing liquidity to any available pairing pools on the Malaia side chain. With a max supply of 250,000,000 tokens here is the current issuance: 50,000,000 shards spread among the team and released over 5 years (Active). 50,000,000 shards in the development treasury released over 2.5 years (Active). 60,000,000 awarded to mission participants over 5 years (Active). 60,000,000 shards awarded to liquidity providers over 5 years (Beginning Q2 2022). 30,000,000 shards saved for tournament and competitive gameplay (Q2 2022). Any $SHRDS used to purchase goods and services directly from the MNNT Ltd. (Fusion, NFT minting, Governance votes, variants...) will get injected back into the ecosystem with the following ratio: 30% back into the missions reward pool. 30% back inside the liquidity provider pool. 15% towards the development wallet to help improve Andrometa and our respective games. 5% will go towards benefitting the Global Proof of Humanity UBI Initiative through the $UBI Protocol. 20% will be either be burned or sent to the community wallet to pay for governance requests. The 20% is split according to the formula X = (total supply / max supply). If X = 1, 20% will be burnt and 0% will go to the community wallet. If X = 0.6, 12% will be burnt and 8% will go to the community wallet. MNNT Ltd. believe this balance of redistribution will allow the token to prosper in the long term thanks to its deflationary nature, without cutting out the rewards given to the community. $SHRDS Staking Users will have the option to stake their $SHRDS in farming pools to assist in the stabilization and overall strengthening of the inter-metaverse economy within Andrometa. An economy made strong due to the efforts of users and players alike. Users that choose to stake their $SHRDS in one of these pools for one (1) year will be rewarded with additional $SHRDS that can then be used and exchanged within Andrometa and MNNT Ltd.'s NFT marketplace.  As explained in the 'Tokenomics' section, 1,000,000 $SHRDS per month will be distributed evenly among all holders that choose to help secure the network and strengthen the economy of Andrometa. This way MNNT Ltd. can combat whales buying up all $SHRDS and controlling the inter-metaverse economy within Andrometa.  Malaia Chain MNNT Ltd. is currently in its final stages of development for its Malaia Chain; a custom built Ethereum linked sidechain developed to enable MNNT Ltd. to scale its ideas and provide users with the best experience within Andrometa and our play-to-earn games.  The Malaia chain is a sidechain based on the Ethereum network. As a result, this chain can run any smart contract compatible with the 'Ethereum Virtual Machine' (EVM). It is currently using a 'Proof of Authority' (PoA) consensus to validate the on chain transactions, however MNNT Ltd. aims to migrate to 'Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus as more people join the ecosystem. The Malaia Chain is linked to the Ethereum Mainnet via a bridge that enables users the ability to move Ethereum, USDC, and $SHRDS between both chains. Malaia Chain will eventually allow ERC721 transfers, but it isn't a priority just yet as the tokens (NFTs) wouldn't have any use outside of the Malaia chain.  The Malaia Chain enables the freedom of a gas free marketplace where players can transact freely, with the security and validation of the blockchain. Allowing a free flowing transfer of digital assets as intended in a player owned and operated blockchain gaming economy. WE ARE THE OUTKAST - Immersive Anime Series A New Immersive Experience MNNT Ltd. is made up of four diehard anime, sci fi, and fantasy fans with decades worth of combined viewership. The inspiration for the NFT artwork comes from anime, Star Wars and steam punk, and the lore behind the Andrometa metaverse is no different. An expansive collection of stories from different worlds that will eventually overlap with each other creating one grandiose saga.  MNNT Ltd. is providing viewers with a digital entertainment experience that is the first of its kind in history. All MNNT Ltd. collections come with limited commercial intellectual property rights for NFT owners. Viewers for the first time in history have the ability to own the actual characters they see and follow throughout the series. Owners of these NFTs can then write certain aspects of an episode's story by spending $SHARDS earned within Andrometa. Equally as important, having ownership over certain characters opens a world of economic possibility to the owner of the NFT. Through reselling merchandise, turning that NFT into their own online brand/persona creating and selling variants, etc. The ability for viewers to interact and have ownership over the characters within the show with the anime series has never been done before. Allowing fans to have an even deeper connection to the characters that they know and love. MNNT Ltd. will change the way we consume entertainment media utilizing blockchain enabled ownership of in show characters, items, and worlds.  Future NFT Collections MNNT Ltd. is producing an anime series that features the diverse continent of Kuier with Andrometa, a land filled with multiple different nations, species and animals. Future NFT collections released by MNNT Ltd. will incorporate the different nations and species found within Andrometa. All the original collections (current and future) released by MNNT Ltd. can be used to create Variants that can be bought and sold, as was mentioned prior.  MNNT Ltd. envisions a future where fans can own the commercial IP rights to their favorite characters within the anime series. These future collections expand that possibility and allow users to truly interact and connect with this anime series on a deeper and more meaningful level.  Market Research The crypto gaming industry had market revenue of US$321 million in 2020 with around 41.9 million gamers owning crypto. According to Newswagg’s research, 38% of them are Millennials aged between 21-38 years old, and they are the biggest age group.  Gamers are also much more likely to own crypto as compared to others— 55% of the Millennial gamers own crypto as compared to just 5% of all Millennials. There’s an immense potential for crypto to be more involved in the gaming industry. Among gamers who own crypto, 80% of them are interested in using cryptocurrency for gaming purchases, and 67% hope there are more opportunities for using cryptocurrency in gaming. Crypto gamers in the Asia-Pacific region generated the highest revenue of US$157.3 million (49%), followed by North Americans with US$80.3 million (25%), Europe, Latin America, as well as Middle East & Africa. Analyzing similarly situated ventures to Andrometa, the industry has seen exponential user growth and profitability in just this past year from play to earn games and Metaverse related content. As quoted by a recent Morgan Stanley Analytics Report, the Metaverse industry is forecasted to be an 8 Trillion dollar industry.  Source: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/morgan-stanley-is-worried-about-facebook-pivot-to-the-metaverse-2021-11 According to a recent analyst note from Jefferries investment bank led by Stephanie Wissink: The NFT market size was nearly $25 billion in 2021. In 2022 the NFT market is expected reach as much as $35 billion in net sales volume. Based on its current growth rate, sources forecast the NFT market to grow to about $80 billion by 2025 and 350 billion by 2030.  Total net sales volume from NFTs was nearly $25 billion in 2021 and about 28.6 million different wallets traded NFTs in 2021. The overall market grew by more than 26,000% versus 2020. NFTs are considered a unique digital product, which is different from tokens that can be exchanged equivalently, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the beginning of 2021, the token prices of NFT concept projects, such as ENJ, NFTX, REHAB, MASK, MEME, etc., have increased by dozens and hundreds of times. A number of celebrities and investment institutions and designer brands have began to embrace NFTs. Most recently Victoria Secret applying for 10 patents for digital wearable accessories, and McDonalds for inter-metaverse food delivery services that blur the lines between digital and tangible business to consumer sales.  At present, a huge ecosystem has been formed in the NFT field. In terms of functions and roles, NFT ecology can be subdivided into many different racetracks, such as public blockchains focusing on building NF"
Gray Boys,10000,3300,0.9,4900,"Preface We expect the volume of people participating in the metaverse and purchasing NFTs to continue to rise rapidly over the coming years. This will inevitably result in a price out of many people interested in the perks and exclusives of the most exciting NFT projects due to limited supply, high demand and floor prices most can’t afford. We created The Mothership DAO and The Gray Boys to solve this problem. A Gray Boys NFT acts as membership to The Mothership DAO. The Mothership DAO acquires NFTs voted on by it’s members through proposals and yields fractionalized ownership and utility benefits to all members for the acquired NFTs. Most importantly though, and the innovative piece of The Mothership DAO, is we’ve developed the ability to pass on perks, utility, verifiability, exclusive content access and more by proxy to all members of the DAO for any NFT of any NFT project that The Mothership DAO acquires. The goal of this is to give The Mothership DAO members access to all of the utility, perks, exclusives and more of fantastic NFT projects that they otherwise would have been priced out of. As well as fractionalized ownership of NFTs held in the DAO’s community vault. Initial Mint Gray Boys will be 0.07 Eth each to mint. The initial pre-sale mint of the Gray Boys will start on November 23rd. The public sale will start on November 26th. All art will be revealed on December 1st. There will be 10,000 Gray Boys available to mint. The reason we selected 10,000 was to give as many people as possible access to the fractionalized and shared utility the DAO yields to its members. 30% of all mint sales will be allocated to the DAO for NFT acquisition as voted on by DAO members. The remaining 70% will be allocated to the community and engineering fund. These funds will be used to ramp up the engineering team underneath the engineering leadership @iamarkdev to aid in building out the core tech, dApps and browser extension to streamline the management of DAO governance, proxy utility, and perks of acquired NFTs to DAO members. Additionally, the community and engineering fund will also be used to drive community growth, visibility and awareness of the project as these types of proposals are presented to the DAO by the team. DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) The DAO is structured in such a way that you are only required to own at least 1 Gray Boy to be a member. Members claim the utility benefits the DAO will offer by the proxy system for the NFTs The Mothership DAO holds in it’s community vault. Fractionalized ownership for held NFTs will be determined by the number of Gray Boys you own. More Gray Boys owned by your address mean greater fractionalized ownership. Each Gray Boy provides the same fixed amount of fractionalized ownership, regardless of its rarity or traits. The Mothership DAO utilizes a fork of Compound Governance and is the main governing body of The Gray Boys and The Mothership’s NFTs, as well as acquisition and liquidation decisions. Our implementation has been inspired by proven work done by the Nouns DAO project as a starting point. DAO votes may be delegated, but by default will be allocated to each Gray Boy NFT holder's address and transferred to new owner addresses upon a sale, regardless of the existing delegation. 1 Gray Boy NFT = 1 DAO Vote. 1 Gray Boy NFT = 1/10,000 fractionalized ownership of the DAO’s NFTs, tokens, etc. Liquidity And NFT Acquisition Acquisition of NFT’s and liquidation shall be done through DAO proposals. Acquired NFTs yield complete proxied utility to all holders to the fullest extent possible. NFTs liquidated shall have funds returned to the DAO for future acquisition and utilization as proposed by the DAO. How Is Proxying NFT Utility Possible? Nearly every NFT project relies on connecting a wallet to verify NFT ownership using a browser extension like Metamask, coinbase wallet, etc. Or requiring you generate a message signature with a wallet that owns an NFT for the project. Herein lies where we propose the idea of a hybrid read-only (often called watch-only) wallet managed by the DAO, allowing DAO members to have the necessary read-only and limited signature generation rights to the wallet that holds NFTs the DAO has selected to acquire. All without ever exposing a private key or ability to transfer or submit transactions with the wallet. We intend to do this through extending the functionality of the open source MetaMask extension, while being within the bounds of their license. For the technical implementation, we intend to do this through creating a read-only wallet implementation within a forked version of metamask as well as creating a signing service to proxy allowed signed messages through the community vault wallet. The end result is the ability to verify ownership for any NFT project and access holder perks for those projects, and more as if those NFTs were exclusively owned by you and as if they were in your local MetaMask wallet. Additionally, all of this will be made open source and publicly viewable through git repositories we’ll provide. All code and implementations will be open to be fully reviewed by peers in the community prior to going live. Lastly, this will be done in such a way that it does not conflict with your existing MetaMask extension. It will run entirely separate and be specific to verification for NFTs The Mothership DAO holds. Secondary Market Royalties 50% of all secondary market royalties will be deposited into the DAO, forever. The remaining 50% will be distributed to the engineering and community fund to further the project’s growth and development. How Will Fractionalized Drops Work? Inevitably, NFTs that The Mothership DAO holds will yield drops of some kind in the future. For these drops, the resulting tokens (fungible and non-fungible), will be stored in the DAO and ownership distributed through the same fractionalized ownership mechanism as all existing tokens in the collection. Utilization of these drops is up to the decision of the DAO members through approved proposals. How Will Discrepancies And Governance Be Handled? After initial mint, the DAO will ultimately have full control and decision over any discrepancies and project direction not outlined in the whitepaper. I Don’t Know What Half This Means, What’s the TLDR? By owning at least 1 Gray Boy NFT, you are a member of The Mothership DAO - a decentralized organization that buys and sells NFTs proposed by and voted on by DAO members in order to give access to more benefits for all members. You also own a percentage of the NFTs owned by The Mothership DAO so long as you own at least 1 Gray Boy NFT. DAO members have access to the fullest extent possible to the perks, utility and benefits yielded by NFTs held in the community vault. This is possible through something called a watch-only wallet, our own clever open source chrome extension, and a guarded signature delegation system that lets you prove ownership when attempting to connect to projects via metamask to “prove” ownership and access utility, which will be possible by the proxy system. This means that should an NFT project that The Mothership DAO holds an NFT for opens up an exclusive game, content, event, etc and they require proof of ownership to access those perks, all Mothership DAO members will be able to access those perks by proxied ownership of the associated NFT(s) held in the DAO’s community vault. All of this will be as simple and automated as connecting your wallet to a dApp with Metamask as most are used to now. There will not be complex processes and the implementations of everything proposed for all dApps, extensions, etc"

STARL,10000,1700,0.073,321,"STARL Project Whitepaper 2.0 Explore the STARL Metaverse https://t.me/starlinkofficial @StarLinkETH W https://starltoken.com 2 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject In a world where people are increasingly using the internet as their main form of connection and self-expression, the metaverse is logically the next step in the way we create, consume, and interact digitally. The popular rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), play-to-earn, increased interest and focus on the metaverse from Facebook and other companies, and a world driven physically apart by a pandemic all indicate a clear trend towards the need for a more comprehensive online platform than what currently exists. Defining the metaverse can be challenging as it can encompass anything we currently do online, but in a simulated 3D digital environment, taking advantage of the digital connectivity we have rapidly developed in the last century. The metaverse will combine online experiences in a fluid and connected way that more accurately reflects the human experience. To do this, we will use tools in the technical world to represent, and improve upon, what we encounter and experience in the physical world. Immense virtual worlds, augmented reality, virtual reality, and the internet will be used as a shared virtual 3D space connecting to all the social, gaming, shopping, research, education, and financial programs we use - all interconnected and interacting in a digital ecosystem. The metaverse will be the hub of it all, a universe in itself. Decentralized networks (cryptocurrency) provide an unparalleled degree of assurance and security with finances in response to a decline in trust towards institutions. It appears inevitable that cryptocurrency may play the most important role in the emergence of the metaverse. STARL aims to anticipate this coming evolution revolution by combining cryptocurrency with the metaverse and building an ethical, decentralized, entertaining, and innovative project: The STARL Metaverse. 1.1abstract 3 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject This is a virtual world that will exist as a space to host data and ideas within the blockchain, while creating new opportunities for the creation and collection of NFTs as a form of self expression, utility, or real estate in the metaverse. In addition, it will act as a hub for marketing, entertainment, socialization, gaming, and education. The STARL token launch was very unique compared to most other cryptocurrency projects. There was no pre-sale or announcement. It was a stealth launch; released with zero notice, making it completely fair and equal. The project has no team or dev token allocations and no tokenomics such as taxes or reflections. Woof Decentra deployed STARL without notice, burning the initial liquidity to assure this would always be a project dedicated to the people that believe in its vision and community. Metaverses are a relatively new concept and technology, and there are very few currently that exist beyond the research phase. None are fully developed, and most are notably underdeveloped. All of them are centralized and controlled by companies or projects with a problematic consolidation of power. The STARL Metaverse is currently the only truly decentralized metaverse project, and it is seeking to merge the concept of the metaverse with a cryptocurrency-based economy. It is based in a space-themed setting for an enhanced experience that taps into what makes humans unique; a drive and desire to explore, learn, and go beyond. STARL will be used as the medium of exchange within the metaverse. It will be used to buy, sell, trade, and modify in-game assets. In addition, STARL will be used as points of entry for various areas of the metaverse, for accessing games, virtual concerts and clubs, media, entertainment, education, modes of travel in the metaverse, investing in virtual real estate, mining for materials in-game, paying other players for services, social experiences and programs, and really anything else that a currency can be used for in the physical world, but virtual. It is a digital currency for the virtual world. 1.2THESTARLMETAVERSE 4 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject While the STARL Metaverse is an interactive 3D universe based in space, with the freedom to explore different virtual worlds and communities, it is not necessarily a game in and of itself. It can instead best be described as a hub for virtual social interaction and expression, and trading and collecting assets within a digital economy. The STARL Metaverse, however, will be filled with gaming. There is no limit to what can be included. The metaverse provides a portal to connect to various missions and adventures which can be embarked on alone or with others. For example, racing games on moons and extraterrestrial lands, shooting games inside abandoned spaceships and bases, spaceships to fly throughout the metaverse and other solar systems and complete missions, space stations to be captured, defended, or used for supplies. All types of games ranging from adventure, action, and education are planned to be included. All games will be connected and accessible through the Market in the 'Play' section, which links directly to the metaverse. The user's statistics and actions can affect the environment, other users, and economy in various ways. Gameplay can affect the metaverse, and the metaverse can affect gameplay. Everything is connected. The central space station hub in the metaverse will be the starting point for all new players. It will be a social and commercial meeting space for everyone. Inside the station, you will be able to access activities available throughout the game. Additionally, there are areas of entertainment, shops, educational facilities, and more. The station will constantly expand as new regions are made available to players. There can be multiple hubs in varying sizes across the universe. The freedom to adventure and play as you choose will create a diverse and dynamic universe that is always interactive and interacting, allowing players to cooperate or compete for resources. You may set out on your journey as a lone wolf pilot, team up with others to achieve more meaningful goals for better rewards, or perhaps engage in player versus player battle and activities to acquire what other users have. The choice is yours. 5 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject The core philosophy of STARL believes that projects can be done fairer, more sustainably, and in a way that can benefit everyone involved. No large corporation or company is looking to extract personal data from the users for advertising or to maximize profits for yearly reports. STARL simply wants people to have fun, interact with each other freely, have access to opportunities that lead to financial freedom, and work towards the next stage in the evolution of the internet and online interaction. We have seen poor outcomes when projects are developed in greedy, unsustainable, or deceptive ways. We want to create something that rises above all these methods. STARL will be empowering, transparent, fun, healthy, and fair. STARL believes strongly in decentralization, holding this value at the core of everything it does. Decentralization gives everyone equal opportunity to be involved and utilize their strengths to help a project grow and the freedom to decide how. There is a social responsibility to provide tools and resources in the virtual space to create a fun and adaptive environment for individuals to thrive and monetize, no matter who or where they are. 1.3COREVALUES One of STARL Satellites Figure 01 6 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject STARL is an ERC-20 token with a total supply of 10 trillion. All tokens are in circulation, with the initial liquidity and contract ownership burned. This means that no further STARL tokens can be minted into circulation. Also, as STARL was 100% fair-launched, all tokens have always been publicly tradable. Unlike most projects, there are no token unlocks for private investors to dilute the current circulating supply, which often results in more stagnant price action as increased buying power is needed after each unlock to further increase the price per token. STARL is fully transparent, completely safe, and 100% community owned and driven. STARL will be used as the medium of exchange within the metaverse. Contract: 0x8e6cd950ad6ba651f6dd608dc70e5886b1aa6b24 No tax, no fee No presale or private unlocks No dev token wallet Total supply 100% circulating Initial liquidity added 100% Unity moving towards Unreal Engine The project's initial development was by the community and started on the Unity real-time video game engine. This is the sector of the metaverse that was created right away and was what could be seen in the first gameplay images that showcased a space hub. Moving forward, development will be worked on professionally using the Unreal Engine (UE). 2.1starltoken 2.2UNIVERSE 7 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject Creating a vast metaverse based in space with a virtual economy would usually require years of development, however, STARL has expedited the process by adapting Warp Nexus - an unreleased AAA space exploration MMO created by Scott Brown and his team, built on Unreal Engine. In addition, Shahid Ahmad, a renowned gaming developer with extensive accolades in the industry, was hired to be an adviser and producer for the transformation of Warp Nexus into the STARL Metaverse. Professionally Designed and Developed on Unreal Engine The professionally developed aspect of the metaverse will continue on Unreal Engine and is an adaptation of Scott Brown's game Warp Nexus. Warp Nexus is a near-complete AAA space exploration, action, adventure, and massively multiplayer online (MMO) game that will be transformed and adapted into the STARL Metaverse. The early stage Unity metaverse Figure 02 8 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject It will focus on space travel and mechanics, space base connections, asteroids and mining, planets, space battles, and a complex and interesting virtual gaming economy. STARL has onboarded a game design and development team with two decades of MMO game development experience and expertise crafting in-game economies. The economy will utilize the STARL token and play a prominent role across all aspects of the metaverse, with decisions and actions affecting various elements. The game development here will implement mechanics that will be utilized across the entire metaverse. Space flight will be the primary method of travel in the metaverse. While the gaming side will focus on missions, the rest of the metaverse will have the option for users to explore, collect assets, mine asteroids, trade in the STARL Market, and interact with others. The Unity progress and development will merge into the Unreal version, which will be the main engine used as development continues. Scott Brown's Warp Nexus which will be adapted for STARL Figure 03 9 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject The concept of play-to-earn is quickly growing in popularity. This is significantly enhanced in places where finding access to paid work may be difficult or for people in challenging personal circumstances where opportunities are lacking. While the play-to-earn mechanism is used in several gaming projects, unfortunately, many have also abused it. We will ensure fair, balanced, and secure mechanisms in gameplay and travel in the metaverse to avoid this. Users will have abilities to play and earn various assets that are valuable in quests and to progress further in-game. These assets will be earned by playing and completing missions or battles while traveling between spaceships and hubs in the metaverse. Users can either use these assets to progress in missions and games or sell them to others for profit on the STARL Market. Assets earned can be common and valuable materials, fuel, tools, or weapons, or rare assets that are hard to find and highly sought after on the market. We also aim to provide a vibrant virtual economy with ways to earn and trade. As we believe in community input, we will steer the direction of the project according to what the community thinks are fair and balanced ways to trade and interact in the virtual world, while also creating a fun and adventure-filled metaverse to explore. We look up to the greats of in-game economies, such as our very own Scott Brown (Jumpgate, and Warp Nexus, which is currently being reconstructed for STARL Metaverse). STARL will learn from the work of projects like these, and create a virtual economy that replicates the real world where actions bring consequences, causes create effects, and what you do not only affects yourself but the world around you. 2.3ECONOMYAND PLAY-TO-EARN 10 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject For example, specific items and components might only be available to craft in particular locations in the metaverse. You could find that demand for features and raw resources is higher at one base or space station, while the demand for finished goods is higher at another. Both users and AI can generate missions to deliver the required products to appropriate locations. Other tasks may require users to extract minerals, deliver miscellaneous goods, and much more, contributing to a dynamic economic system based on primary supply and demand. If missions are accepted but fail due to pirate activity or attack, then subsequent tasks will be implemented to combat the pirates in those areas. Thus, users will not only participate in the metaverse, but they will have a part in shaping, affecting, and responding to it. STARL will be used in the STARL Market (https://market.starltoken.com/ market). The STARL Market will host all the NFTs and assets needed ingame. Once those NFTs are purchased, they will interact with the metaverse, or games within the metaverse, in various ways. The Market enables participants to manage and exchange SATE NFTs, Virtual Real Estate, and other assets such as in-game wearables and tools. It will also sell customizations for modules, satellites, vehicles, and characters. Additionally, skins, clothes, furniture for the modules, and other various upgrades will be available. Other in-game assets will also be sold in our Market - weapons, health upgrades, ship upgrades, and much more. All these assets, represented as NFTs, will be bought and sold using STARL. Metaverse travelers will have the ability to earn assets in the universe and games that can be traded on the market. These assets will give the user various properties and abilities to continue their quests and exploration depending on their goal and direction. Someone may earn an asset in 2.4MARKET 11 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject The STARL Market Figure 04 game that may not be the one they want at the specific time or suit their current needs, making the ability to trade with others on the secondary market necessary and useful. With blockchain technology, every digital satellite and other virtual assets in the STARL ecosystem can be tokenized, giving holders the ability to trade, sell, or gift their items. Users are the perpetual owners of their digital assets. Blockchain allows them to have true ownership, with the ability to monetize and freely trade their assets. 12 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject Once a user signs into the Market with their wallet, they will be able to set up their 'Profile'. This is a graphical representation of users in the virtual space metaverse. It is linked to the wallet address, and will be used for the marketplace and the metaverse. Users can link their personal information, social media profiles, personal website, and more. Messaging can be implemented through synching Telegram in Profiles, and this will allow our STARL Telegram community to link with profiles and users in the Market and metaverse. Users that are bidding on NFTs will have their Profile name displayed in the 'Offers' section. Profiles can display unique NFT profile pictures. The PIXELNAUTS collection is the first volume in STARL’s new 'Artist Profile Series'. Users can mint a unique, original, and limited NFT to use as their Profile picture, or trade on the marketplace. Each STARL 'Artist Profile Series' will feature a theme created and curated by one artist. Each NFT has a set of unique characteristics that can be traded and collected. 2.5profile STARL Marketplace user profile With Pixelnaut Figure 05 13 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject 2.6satellites Satellite NFTs can be bought through the STARL Market and have annual percentage rate (APR) rewards. SATE contracts for satellites earn interest on the amount of the STARL spent to purchase your satellite in auction. The APR rates for each satellite are different depending on which category they are in. These satellites provide a service as spaces for digitally displaying art and advertisements. They could also offer special ability increases to users who own them, or allow others to. For example, if you and your team are about to engage in a battle against other players, or an especially challenging mission, you may fly to your satellite first and boost your attack power, before leaving on your mission. Satellites will be categorized by orbit types: Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geostationary or Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO). • LEO satellites are positioned at an altitude between 160 km and 1,600 km (100 and 1,000 miles) above Earth. TYPHON by JSnori Figure 06 14 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject • MEO satellites operate from 10,000 to 20,000 km (6,300 to 12,500 miles) from Earth • GEO satellites are positioned at 36,000 km from Earth. They match the rotation of the Earth as they travel, and so remain above the same point on the ground. APR Rewards for Satellite orbit category is below: • Platinum: GEO: 20% • Gold: MEO: 15% • Bronze: LEO: 10% Any address with ownership of a SATE NFT will earn interest based on the amount of STARL spent on the SATE at the initial auction. For instance, in an auction that closes for 10 Billion STARL, the owner would subsequently earn a yearly APR of 20% (Class A), 15% (Class B ) or 10% (Class C) based on the Satellite Class purchased. In this example, the yearly interest for a Class A Sate would be 2 Billion STARL until the payout matches amount paid for satellite. 30% of NFT sales and auctions will be used to fund this APR. Morpheus satellite by Flipacadabra Figure 07 15 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject 2.7livingmodules Living Modules will be one form of virtual real estate in the STARL Metaverse. They represent your personal quarters where you can store your items, customize the interior, and display your digital art and NFTs. Further utilities of living modules may include abilities to regain health, customize character outfits, and rent quarters out to other users for profit so they too can improve health and gain various power-ups for in-game usage. Living Module NFTs act as key cards to access your home on each base in the metaverse. The first round available were 128 Limited Edition Living Modules, each an original and unique design by a 3D artist. These were available during the initial drop, and also via secondary sales when this function is implemented in the marketplace. Due to their unique design, the first Limited Editions are likely be sought after as valuable assets. If there is high demand, more 3D Artist rendered Limited Edition Living Modules may be considered, however, standard modules will also be available for everyone further into development. While these subsequent Living Modules will not be limited edition one-off designs, they will still carry attributes, and will be available for purchase to all travellers of the metaverse. Although the living modules do not generate APR rewards (unlike satellites) they will be highly useful and desirable as virtual real estate in the metaverse, as well as carrying special perks and boosts. Cassiopeia by AnimatedBex Figure 08 16 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject DAO 2.8STARLDAO A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. Instead, decisions are governed by a community and organized around a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain. DAOs are internet-native organizations collectively owned and managed by their members. STARL will utilize its token to eventually launch a process allowing all holders to vote on the project's future direction or changes that will be implemented as the metaverse evolves. This will ensure that the metaverse remains relevant and enjoyable for the people it serves and maintains the core tenant of decentralization. 17 WHITEPAPER 2.0 Starlproject ? STARL Token Launch ?

Galaxy Fight Club,10100,2600,0.45,7200,"Galaxy Fight Club Official Galaxy Fight Club White paper, last updated Feb 2022 Disclaimer: information outlined in this white paper and on our website is constantly updated and adjusted to deliver the best gaming experience; content on both platforms should not be taken as investment advice and does not constitute any offer or recommendation of any investment product. We are building a cross-IP PvP game for the NFT Universe - this would be the best way to describe what we are trying to do. The Galaxy Fight Club (GFC) is not just an avatar project, it is a real-time PvP game to bring together all the other different NFT collections onto one single platform, this means you can 'log-in' with an NFT you have already bought and battle with that character. Referencing Matthew Ball, one of the core attributes of the Metaverse is that it offers unprecedented interoperability of digital items/assets. In other words, you can use your ‘Counter-Strike’ gun skin to decorate a gun in Fortnite. Offer unprecedented interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences — your “Counter-Strike” gun skin, for example, could also be used to decorate a gun in Fortnite, or be gifted to a friend on/through Facebook. Similarly, a car designed for Rocket League (or even for Porsche’s website) could be brought over to work in Roblox. Today, the digital world basically acts as though it were a mall where every store used its own currency, required proprietary ID cards, had proprietary units of measurement for things like shoes or calories, and different dress codes, etc. — Matthew Ball Yet the current state of the NFT space feels very siloed, there is still little collaboration between different collections, and to our knowledge no platform where different IPs from different collections can interact with each other. We see this as a challenge that is preventing the NFT space from growing into something more and it’s a problem that we want to solve with GFC but instead of creating new utility-based collections, we want to create and add utility for existing NFT avatar collections like the Cryptopunks and the BAYC. Galaxy Fight Club's Mission Galaxy Fight Club's mission to to be the Nintendo of Web3, but instead of franchises coming together in a closed loop we believe in the interoperability of digital items/assets in a truly open ecosystem where the players, instead of the company own the IP. We aim to create a cross-IP game platform for the NFT Universe where different IPs from different collections can interact with each other in a meaningful way. The Vision In the fictional Metaverse of Ready Player One called Oasis, there are different planets known for different experiences and players hop between each planet with their avatars. In the future we see Galaxy Fight Club as the go-to platform for PvP experiences, a player might login to the Sandbox when they want to relax and build but come to Galaxy Fight Club for fighting, combat and excitement. Team Over half of our team comes from the traditional games industry and majority of the team members are based across Asia. Below is a list of all the core team members of the project, individuals not on this list are hired to help or volunteers on the project. CHIEF GAME OFFICER (CGO) Dan Le was brought on as the full-time Lead Game Designer on the project after launch, he has worked in the gaming industry for the past 5 years since 2016. Starting his career at OneSoft and then moved to VNG between 2017 - 2020. Vietnamese studios and developers have created many of the top hits recently including Axie Infinity and VNG is one of the top 4 largest game publishers in Vietnam. Dan worked as the lead game designer on Samurai Shodown and was also part of the team that created Metal Wings, GunPow 3D, AU Mobi, and other mobile titles. Dan is not a proficient English speaker but it doesn't impact his ability to create a great game, he will be working with 3 other full-time game developers including a Lead programmer, 3D environment artist and 2D-3D artist on this project. MARKETING & PARTNERSHIP Ado comes from a strategy consulting background across different industries including financial services and tech and has been working for a large gaming business more recently. Ado understands and has deep connections in the gaming industry, he is responsible for everything on the business and marketing side of GFC. LEAD BLOCKCHAIN DEV Dave is the smart contract/web3 software engineer. Dave was offered a position in a smart contract development firm, which focuses on providing trading standards for DEXs. He works very closely with smart contracts and knows a great deal about them. Dave has been working with Blockchain technology for over 2 years, we believe his experience can bring benefits to the project. CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER (CMO) Yassin is a strategist thinker with a passion for innovation, business development and marketing. He started his marketing agency in 2016 and found his interest in NFTs in early 2021. Since then he has been actively invested in different projects until he found his position with GFC, currently based in Germany. ARTISTS Our lead artist is Don, he is an award-winning digital art/designer with a degree in Fine Arts and years of experience in Multimedia Arts and Design. Illustration is Don’s expertise, specializing in cartoon, comic art and caricature.  Our seed and private round was led by Animoca Brands, Sequoia India Capital and The Chernin Group. Galaxy Fight Club’s vision is to build a truly open ecosystem with interoperability of digital items where the players, instead of the company, own their IP. On this cross-IP game platform, players will be able to login and battle with the NFTs that they own such as a Bored Ape or a Cryptoadz, enabling different IPs from different collections to interact with each other in a meaningful way.  Additional backers and partners in the round include Skyvision Capital, YGG SEA, Spartan Capital, Sfermion, PKO Investments, Infinity Ventures Crypto, Huobi Innovation Labs, Kucoin Labs, Rarestone Capital, Formless Capital, Gerstenbrot Capital, Perion, Double Peak Group, Polkastarter, MEXC, MoonEdge, RR2 Capital, Edimus Capital, Bondly, Astronaut Capital, Panony, 18 Ventures, Zokyo as well as many other notable angel investors including Kevin Lin of Twitch, Kun Gao of Crunchyroll and Matt Finick of ROBLOX and Marvel Studios. In Ready Player One there are different planets known for different experiences and players hop between each planet with their avatars. At the moment most P2E games are still turn-based and not that enjoyable, Galaxy Fight Club is designed to be fun-to-play first, play-to-earn second. in the future we see Galaxy Fight Club as that go-to planet for PvP experiences known for fighting, combat and excitement. Our round was significantly over-subscribed, we spent the last several months speaking to a large number of VCs and being selective about who we bring onboard. All of our investors were selected not just because of their financial backing but more importantly the strategic value each of them bring to the project. We look forward to working with our partners to build out our vision over the coming years. We brought on these advisors to the project because of their deep expertise in the gaming space, they will be working with us to give advice around game design, tokenomics and beyond. We look forward to working with these individuals closely to help build out the full vision of what Galaxy Fight Club could be in the coming months and years.

Partners Note: not all partnerships are listed out on this page Galaxy Fight Club's mission is to break down the silos between different NFT projects in the space. As part of this mission, Galaxy Fight Club has already established a number of partners with leading tier 1 NFT-native projects like Cyberkongz, BYOPills as well as GameFi projects like Illuvium. Galaxy Fight Club provides/adds long-term utility to these projects by giving them access to our platform while they help to make it easier for us to turn our vision of creating a Super Smash Bros for the NFT universe into reality.  We can and will be including any avatar collection we chose to prioritize, and all major avatar projects will be added into the game over time whether there is a partnership or not, as long as the NFT rights belong to its owner instead of the collection. By signing into the game and agreeing to terms of use, the owner of these NFTs will give Galaxy Fight Club the rights to create derivative work. The whole point of NFTs is OWNERSHIP, and this means allowing the owner to decide what to do with it, whether to play the game or not. If a user does not want to play or participate with their avatars, they do not have to and we would never display your avatars in our game without your permission. 2022 Roadmap We completed our Genesis Galaxy Fighter collection mint in August 2021 and the Genesis Gear collection mint in November 2021, these NFTs can now be purchased on the Opensea secondary market. Closed beta was released in November 2021, the team is now executing according to the following roadmap and marketing schedule below: Participation Everyone can participate in Galaxy Fight Club, If a player does not have access to any avatars, they will be given a default fighter with base stats and a default base tier weapon; if they have a partnered project’s avatar, they can play with that; if they have a Genesis Galaxy Fighter they can also play with that. The only difference is that the loot/rewards that you can earn from winning are different based on the avatar or weapon you play with (see Play To Earn section for more details)  Teams of the same collection will receive a team bonus in combat stats. The game is also designed to cater to multiple types of players, if a player does not enjoy taking part in the actual battles they can play the game as a manager and focus on renting out their stable of fighters to others to fight for them with loot share; or one can become a crafter and focus on finding the best ingredients to forge into newer and stronger weapons for arbitrage opportunities - there is no one way to play the game and these are all viable paths to play-to-earn. Free to Play F2P players (players who don't own any NFTs) can also play to earn inside our game. F2P players will be given a default base character that they can battle with, winning matches will allow them to win Silver Keys. These Silver Keys could be sold directly on the marketplace as independent NFTs for $ETH or you could keep them and open loot boxes with $GCOIN which gives you loot that could potentially be worth more than the keys themselves. To earn more from the game there are a few options: You could purchase a Genesis Galaxy Fighter which generates between 5-15 $GCOINs per day and allow you to win Gold Keys as well as participate in the tournaments You could purchase a 2nd Generation Galaxy Fighter which allows you to win Gold Keys and participate in the tournaments You could purchase a weapon from the Genesis Gear Collection which allows you to win Gold Keys regardless of which avatar you play with Game Modes Mode Requirements Rewards 3v3 Anyone can play Loot box keys  Tournaments Galaxy Fighters $GOIN, $ETH 1v1 Anyone can play Not available Battle Royale Anyone can play  TBC 3v3 (Main game mode) This is the main mode of the game, 3v3 mode allows you to either enter as a pre-made team or get matched with others to play. You can play in this mode whether you are playing as a Galaxy Fighter or as an avatar from another collection or even if you are a F2P player with no avatar; the only impact is the type of loot box keys you can get as rewards at the end of a round. Tournaments Team tournaments are in 3v3 format, and instead of finding teammates through online matchmaking you will only be able to enter a tournament with pre-made teams. You can find team mates in our discord or find friends and family who might be interested to join you. Only Galaxy Fighters can enter into tournaments (Genesis or 2nd generation). A match is over when either team has 20 points (1 point = 1 kill), the winning team will advance through the tournament until the final. The team that wins the final will win the $ETH or $GCOIN prize which will be split three-way among the 3 team members. 1v1 This is the classic death match mode, players will enter into the battle arena and the player who accumulate 10 points (1 kill = 1 point) first will win the match. There are no rewards to this mode. Battle Royale A classic Battle Royale mode where 10 players join the same battle arena and the last man standing wins. A death ring will appear on the borders on the map to slowly shrink the area which fighters can fight in. The rewards to the Battle Royale mode are to be determined. MechanicsA real-time NFT PvP gameThe game will be a 3D hyper-casual styled fighting game that is similar to Brawl Stars, fighters will be able to engage in both melee or ranged attacks depending on the weapon that they have selected with a movement system that allows them to move up, move down, left, right as well as the ability to engage with several obstacles and objects scattered across the map. Two main factors determine the outcome of a battle in equal measures: The overall strength of your Fighter is decided by their traits (namely base race, armor, and weapon)  Your gameplay performance. We don’t want this to be a pay-to-win game where a rarer fighter will destroy everyone else. Although a rare fighter with strong armor and weapons provides a significant advantage, it is still only half the equation as the rest will depend on how well you can actually play the game. It is entirely possible that a more skilled player in the game with a 50 percentile fighter can beat a 80 percentile player. Battle Arenas Our game is set in the year 2049 and as such our first battle arena will be set in a cyberpunk themed high rise rooftop, there will be battle arenas of other themes to follow including one set in space, one set in a jungle and others. The battle arenas will be scattered with health packs, boosters, hiding places and other obstacles. StatsThree factors determine the overall strength of your fighter: Race (25%) Clothes (Armour) (25%) Weapon (50%) These three elements together make up the total strength of your fighter. Other traits in a fighter can also add bonus points to their overall strength, as an example fighters with laser eyes obviously increases their attack power and fighters wearing helmets obviously have increased defense. Matching armour pieces will also add bonus points, for example plasma armour with a plasma helmet. As a general rule, the stats of a race, armour or weapon is closely related to their rarity which means a rare race with a rare weapon will almost always be stronger than one that is more common. Leveling & Ranking Systems NFT Level – Every NFT fighter will be assigned a level based on the experience points accumulated by playing Galaxy Fight Club. Experience points are unique to each NFT fighter, cannot be transferred to other NFTs, and cannot be lost. Increasing a fighter’s level will increase their combat stats, resulting in stronger fighters. Account Rank – Every account (wallet) will be assigned a rank based on the number of trophies accumulated by playing Galaxy Fight Club. Trophies are gained or lost depending on in-game victories and losses. An account’s rank influences matchmaking and determines the likelihood of receiving loot boxes at the end of matches. Increasing your account’s rank will increases your chances of receiving loot boxes. Account Ranking System Ranking is a system that sort players into different tiers based on the number of trophies they have accumulated. Trophies are awarded to a player’s account when a match is won and deducted from a player’s account when a match is lost. Trophies are assigned to an account (wallet), not an individual NFT.The purpose of a ranking system is to: Ensure fair matchmaking, by allowing players with similar skillsets to compete against one another; Determine eligibility and entry requirements for exclusive tournaments; and Reward successful players with more loot boxes.  An account’s rank directly impacts the drop rate of keys (loot boxes) when a match is won. The higher an account’s rank, the more likely they will receive rewards when they win in-game. This reward mechanism will be modified to discourage anti-competitive behaviour (such as deliberately losing games to compete against easier, lower-ranked players) and award those players who are victorious in the arena. This mechanism also encourages play-to-earn players to play more often. There are 40 different ranks, which are then categorised into 8 different leagues. NFT Leveling System Levels are assigned to an individual NFT fighter and impact an NFT’s in-game strength. Levels are gained by earning experience points. A NFT fighter will earn experience points by completing games, with more points being awarded for victories. Experience points are not deducted for losses and therefore an NFT’s level will never decrease (unlike ranks which fluctuate, as trophies are lost when a player is defeated). Leveling up a NFT fighter improves its combat strength (stats), increasing the likelihood of winning games. The leveling system applies to NFT fighters from the GFC Universe as well as NFT fighters from other projects and collections. Experience points are tied to each unique NFT fighter. When an NFT is sold, the NFT’s experience points (and level) will also be transferred to the new owner. Levels are tied to the NFTs themselves to enable a true play-to-earn mechanism. Players will be able to buy untrained fighters, train them up, and re-sell them at a higher value (as the increase in the NFT’s level results in stronger, more valuable fighter). F2P players can also level-up using their base character although it isn't an NFT, there is a lower cap on the maximum level F2P players can get to versus an NFT character. Fighters Userbase and monthly active users (MAU) are important metrics that should be increasing over time for a healthy game and our system is set up to achieve this goal while ensuring the value given to the original Galaxy Fighters also increases over time. Fighters form the basic block to our game, and we aim to integrate as many of the PFP collections into our game as possible which allows an ever-increasing userbase and our game modes is designed to optimise for this outcome (see 'Partners') We will be working towards having a unique in-game character for every single unique NFT in each collection, for example there would be 10,000 unique in-game characters for BAYC, each in-game character only unlockable with their corresponding NFT. The images above shows 2 examples. This is clearly a very labour intensive process as it will require the creation of every unique trait in each collection, which is why our initial game release will not have a unique in-game character for each NFT but instead will have unique characters by race/fur/type. As an example the following in-game characters will be available for the Bored Apes:  Collection In-game Character BAYC Brown Ape  BAYC Black Ape BAYC Golden Brown Ape BAYC Cream Ape BAYC Tan Ape BAYC Pink Ape BAYC Gray Ape  BAYC Blue Ape BAYC Red Ape BAYC Cheetah Ape BAYC White Ape BAYC Zombie Ape BAYC Robot Ape BAYC DMT Ape BAYC Death Bot Ape BAYC Noise Ape BAYC Trippy Ape BAYC Solid Gold Ape The Battle stats to the fighters will not be revealed and remain hidden for a number of reasons, first of all we believe part of the enjoyment is figuring out which fighter or which traits are stronger, secondly we do not want this to turn into a pay-to-win game, finally it also allow for more fair cross-collection battle, if the Galaxy Fighter tokens have their stats visible but the other collection do not then it creates an imbalance of information between GFC token owners and partnering collection Genesis Galaxy Fighters Our very own 10K collection Genesis Galaxy Fighters are the original 10K NFTs we launched in August 2021, these are playable characters in our game alongside avatars from other collections. They are called Genesis to differentiate from the 2nd Generation fighters which are trained with the Genesis Galaxy Fighters, and are unique because they are the only characters that generate a daily yield of $GCOIN, our in-game currency. Link to GFC Genesis Galaxy Fighters: GFC Genesis Galaxy Fighters The Value of Genesis Galaxy Fighters The value of Genesis Galaxy Fighters is maintained and increased as the game user-base grows through a number of ways 5–15 $GCOIN generation Ability to win Gold Keys Participate in the exclusive weekly tournaments of $2ETH/$GCOIN prize Train 2nd generation fighters which has the same benefits as the Genesis Galaxy Fighters with no $GCOIN yield Access to exclusive Discord channelGalaxy FightersWhile all major NFT collections will be integrated into Galaxy Fight Club, there is an original 10,129 Galaxy Fighter collection. These Galaxy fighters come from 7 different races, the human race alone will have 8 variants. As a general rule the rarer the race of the fighter is, the stronger it will be in battle, Gold Humans are the rarest but they are not necessarily the strongest on the power scale because they are considered a Human race variant instead of a unique race (many of the gold humans are very strong however due to the rarer armour that comes with them compared to the ones available for stronger races). 7 Races: Humans, Beasts, Ogre, Alien, Reptar, Glopz, Death Robot* 8 Human Variants: Albino, Yakuza, Zombie, Mutated, Female, Trippy, Cyborg, Gold *One of the 7 races is the Death Robot, this was airdropped to holders that held all 6 races from the original Galaxy Galaxy Fighters collection in their wallet shortly after the minting event back in August. This is the rarest race with just 135 created, they are also the strongest due to their rarity however they come without weapons or armour.

Companions Link to GFC Companion: GFC Companion?Companions were airdropped to certain holders which met specific requirements in August, Companions will have future utility in the game. For example, you will be able to bring them into the battle with you to deal extra damage to your opponents or help you absorb damage. Companions do not yield $GCOINs like the original Galaxy Fighters do. Training (2nd Gen Fighters)Training is GFC's version of what many other projects called 'Breeding', it allows a Genesis Galaxy Fighter to create a 2nd generation Galaxy Fighter, the training process looks like this: 1 Galaxy Fighter + 4 weapons (burned) + 800 $GCOIN = 2nd generation Galaxy Fighter There will be a 30% GCOIN discount to the price of training in the first week from release.The rarity of the 2nd generation Galaxy Fighter is determined by the weapons you use to train it, and unlike forging, you will be able to use a combination of both ranged and melee weapons as training ingredients. Using higher tiers weapon and OG weapons for training will significantly increase the chances of receiving a rare 2nd generation. You can use 1 OG weapon as an ingredient in any particular forge and it will have a chance for your forged weapon to skip a tier, for example using OG Gloves to forge with 2 other uncommon weapons will result in a 33% chance of skipping Rare to an Epic tier weapon. The Generation 1 Galaxy Fighter used in the training process will also have an effect on the rarity of the Gen 2 fighter, the stronger and more rare the Gen 1 fighter is, the stronger and more rare his students will be. 2nd generation fighters are special for the following reasons: On average stronger than Gen 1 fighters Ability to earn Gold Keys Participate in the exclusive weekly tournaments of $2ETH/$GCOIN prize Access to exclusive Discord channelWeapons Weapons are a scarce resource in the game and demand will always exceed supply Weapons are a key resource inside the game and is designed to always be in short-demand, it will be a hard to come, highly valuable resource which makes the progression to get the best weapon and most rare generation 2 fighter a long term one. Like Galaxy Fighters, there are 8 different tiers to them, they are extremely important in the game loop for a few 3 reasons:  They make up 50% of the strength of a fighter  Each of the original Galaxy Fighter comes with their own weapon which can be used inside the game, similar to the fighters themselves, the strength of the weapon is correlated with their rarity and tier. There will also be a difference between melee and ranged weapons, ranged weapons will have bigger reach/shooting distance while melee weapon is limited to close quarters but generally deal greater damage.  If you want to swap out your weapon you will need a swappable weapon which are unique NFTs, this means every single player in the future will likely want to switch or upgrade their weapon, we believe a DAU of 100K players in the medium to long term is realistic (10K Genesis Fighters, 10K 2nd Gen Fighters, 50K fighters from 20+ partnered collections, F2P players).

They are used in forging  Weapons are the raw ingredients to forge stronger weapons (please read the Forging sub-section for more clarity)  x # of weapons + $GCOINs (burned) = next tier of weapon  3. They are used to train a 2nd generation fighter  1 Galaxy Fighter + x # weapons (burned) + $GCOIN (burned) = 2nd generation Galaxy Fighter  Please see the 'Training' sub-section under 'Fighters' for more details. Forging Forging refers to the process of combining a number of weapons into a higher tier and stronger weapon at The Blacksmith. Unlike training which requires a Genesis Galaxy Fighter to take place, forging does not require you to  x # of weapons + 500 $GCOINs = next tier of weapon  Our weapons contract will be using the ERC1155 to make the forging logic more simple, it will allow players to forge a number of lower tier weapons into a higher tier weapon fully on-chain using a custom function. A player will have to take x number of weapons (also called materials/ingredients) to The Blacksmith, they will the need to pay a fixed amount of $GCOIN and the blacksmith will then forge the lower tier weapons into a higher tier weapon. The specific weapon that comes out of the forge will be randomly generated however ranged weapons will always generate a ranged weapon and melee weapons will forge into a melee weapon. The Forge mechanic is designed to get rid of excess supply of low level weapons in the game while burning $GCOIN supply from the game economy, it also offer a way for progression for serious players by obtaining more and more powerful weapons.  Ingredients Tier # of Ingredients needed Product Basic  4 Common Common  4 Uncommon Uncommon  3 Rare Rare  2 Epic Epic 2 Legendary  Legendary 2 Mythic Mythic 2 Exotic Why we have a forging system  We have both a weapon forging AND a breeding mechanism (which we call 'Training) because helps create a more long-term sustainable game, by enabling both vertical progression element of the game in addition to the horizontal progression (training/breeding).  This is a lesson we have learned from other games, for example, Axie's model allow players to earn money by farming SLP and the value of SLP is driven by breeding Axies which is driven by more players coming into the ecosystem. The 'Training' part of our game is exactly like this, you can train new Galaxy Fighters using $GCOIN and the new Galaxy Fighters allow you to win better loot and participate in the weekly tournaments. The problem with a game that ONLY has a training/breeding mechanic is that it puts a cap on their userbase and also leads to asset inflation of in-game economy (original fighters become weaker). A solution to this and one which Axie Infinity is implementing in early 2022 is actually allowing players to upgrade Axies, so demand for SLP/GCOIN is not only driven by creating more (quantity) of fighters/Axies but also from improving the "

All 10,000 will be up for grabs by the entire NFT community Community events, rewards, virtual & physical interactions, raffles, and more Rewards. (Over $600k+ will be given back to the community through rewards, events, giveaways, and more.) A strong team of 15+ members and 3rd-party companies Overview Introduction  As NFT owners, there are inherently plenty of questions surrounding our identity. Who are we? Who forms the backbone of our community?  The answer is indicative of the beauty of the NFT movement. The short answer; we don't know exactly who, exactly, comprises our community. We use our social platforms to express our unique personalities and stories through NFTs and artwork we purchase. We are not about fake likes, posts, and stories on Instagram. We have a passion for what we do. We are all Incognito. This collection consists of 10,000 unique “Incognitos,” randomly combined from tens of thousands of different possibilities. These NFTs live on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 tokens. The only way to fully Go Incognito is by purchasing your own NFT, thus becoming part of the Incognito family. All 10,000 NFTs will be available for purchase, thereby expanding the opportunity to join our community. As founders, we believe in buying back the floor instead of reserving a certain amount upfront. We’ve also instructed our staff members not to mint any ICONs as we'll be purchasing them from the secondary market. When creating the initial prototypes, our main goal with the Incognito collection was to elevate the design of our NFTs. We wanted our designs to have meaning, which is why we endeavor to create NFTs that hold real artistic value and quality that is unmatched in the community. To accomplish this reality, we set one simple goal: create something astonishing that is guaranteed to be remembered. We rather see them up on every collector's wall, instead of their Twitter profiles. Ideally, we would like both to happen! 3D-NFT Art Over three months of planning, prototypes, designing, rendering, and brainstorming went into the creation of the entire Incognito collection NFT artwork. We strove for perfection, wanting to create something visually unique and well-executed. Our artwork is as important for us as our security, community, ERC-721 contract, and every vital part of this project. We are meticulous through every step of the design process. 2D-NFTs have typically been the norm in the NFT space. So far, not many artists and collections are leveraging 3D-NFT space, especially when it comes to collections of our size. We are eager to explore the possibilities of the 3D space. Each NFT will have downloadable content that can be accessed through our website, providing collectors with access to 3D files for 3D printing, rendering, premade animations, and a full 6k resolution image of your Incognito. We will continue to add even more utility & content for each NFT. Special Rewards These are the 7 special rewards that will be given out to the lucky Incognito holders of each unique 1/1 ICON NFT. Introduction A significant feature of the Incognito collection is the rewards we give out to fellow Incognitos. These rewards will range from numbered hoodies to $80k+ art pieces such as paintings, sculptures, drawings, and more. Our goal with these rewards is to give back to our community and help them understand how important they are to our movement. Our rewards are carefully chosen to bring elements of the digital and physical art world together. We accomplish this through a variety of raffles, events, scavenger hunts, giveaways, etc… as well as through beautiful digital and physical art.  *Note: All 10,000 NFTs are designed and created by Leonardo Fonseca, our Art Director & 3D artist. All physical rewards are created by the mentioned artists or companies. The Incognito NFTs are not designed by these artists/brands. CryptoPunk 9709 CryptoPunk 9709 will be given out to one unique Incognito member who mints the unique ICON that represents this CP. This CryptoPunk is owned by the legendary Wilcox who has agreed to reserve it uniquely for the collection. We will be unlocking this CryptoPunk and making the purchase once we hit 25% sales in the collection. This reward will be given out 48 hours after the purchase is made. This is done to give the NFT owner some time to trade or sell his or her NFT to someone who might be interested in both NFTs. Once time runs out, we'll send the CryptoPunk to the address that owns the unique ICON. Everything will be announced and tracked through our Discord Server. 5 x LEGO Sculptures (By Nathan Sawaya) These will be unique-looking ICONs made out of Legos. Previews will be posted on our website and social media accounts. Nathan Sawaya is the first contemporary artist to bring LEGO®, the world’s most popular toy, into the art world as a medium. His obsessive and painstakingly crafted work captivates viewers by its beauty and playfulness, combining innovation with a nostalgic feeling that brings one back to the possibilities of childhood. His ability to transform LEGO® bricks into interesting figures, devotion to scale and color perfection, and conceptualization of action of the subject matter enable him to elevate a basic toy to fine art status. (Avant Gallery). Nathan is the most famous LEGO® artist in the world. These sculpture rewards will all unlock once we hit 50% in sales. Alec Monopoly Painting As one of our favorite artists in the world, we are happy to include one of Alec Monopoly's paintings in our unique rewards pool. We have officially reserved one of his paintings from his famous Crypto Collection. We would like to thank the Eden Fine Art Gallery for making this possible. Alec Monopoly is an internationally renowned graffiti artist with over 1.2 Million Instagram followers. This painting will unlock once we hit 70% in sales. We’ll be purchasing the painting directly from the Eden Fine Art Gallery in NYC. We will include a professional metal print of your ICON NFT, and a uniquely designed hat & hoodie (1/1 Other ICON Rewards These are rewards that will be given to specif ICON holders who own Incognitos with ICON attributes.

We expect to sell out in a matter of hours, but if this does not happen, we'll honor each of the rewards as we reach the specific goals. We will be giving everyone 96 hours (four days) to trade or sell their NFTs. After the four days are over, the owner/address will be able to claim the reward(s), all other trades after those four days are over will not change who can claim the reward. Claiming process for hoodies and hats will be started exactly four days after launch. This claiming process will be open for a couple of days, each NFT owner will need to send us their shipping information to claim their rewards. Unclaimed clothing rewards will be unassembled and repurposed. UNLOCKS - Once each reward is unlocked, we will announce it via Discord and all other social platforms. Each reward will have instructions on how to redeem it. For most rewards, we will require information such as shipping address, hoodie size, and other information. Incognito Hats will likely be delivered within 1-2 weeks, while Incognito Hoodies will have a 2-3 week lead time since they are ordered and manufactured after the launch and after all NFT holders have claimed their reward. ALTERNATIVE COMPENSATION - We will try our best to ship worldwide but there will be some countries to which we will be unable to provide shipping. In the case that we are unable to ship a hat, hoodie, or metal print, we will provide monetary compensation or extra time to sell the reward(s) to someone in our community. This is something we will work on with each individual personally, to try and find a way to make shipping arrangements work. Special Rewards All of the special rewards have their own condition for ""unlock"" and production times. Each reward has its unlock goal on the main information page.

Incognito is an NFT collection issued on the Ethereum blockchain network. ERC721 Standard Metamask & Wallet connect protocol support The minting process will work by using your web browser with Metamask wallet or through any wallet that implements the wallet connect protocol (Trust Wallet, Exodus, Argent, Rainbow, etc) Provenance Hash For each Incognito image, content is hashed using SHA-256 algorithm. A combined string is obtained by concatenating SHA-256 of each one in a specific order. The final proof is obtained by SHA-256 hashing this combined string, finally this is the provenance record stored on the smart contract. Each Incognito token ID is assigned to an artwork image from the initial sequence with this formula:(tokenId + startingIndex) % 10000 ? Initial Sequence Index IPFS for metadata storage IPFS stands for Interplanetary File System, a decentralized File Storage solution Once a file is stored in the IPFS it cannot be changed / altered / destroyed / by anyone, not even the creator. Our Website is built using the latest web3 technologies: - Runs on a CDN (Netlify) with DDoS attack protection - Vue.js as frontend framework, light, fast, and resilient - Web3.js + Truffle.js Provenance A complete copy of our provenance, part of the smart contract. Will be updated once all changes are done to the metadata. Coming soon. ICON Team Our team information, details, and more. Introduction The most important part of an NFT collection or project is the team that runs it. This is why our first goal was to find professionals for each specific area of this project. In order to find the right person for the right job, our search started slow, but after some time and luck, we managed to bring together the best team we could have ever asked for. Our team spans the globe, from Australia to Argentina, and everywhere in between. Both individuals and third-party companies came together to make the Incognito vision a reality. We feel very confident in the combined expertise, professionalism, and passion of every member of our team. Technology The core of every NFT collection is its technology. This is why we decided to look for a group of developers instead of one or two individuals common with other collections. We teamed up with a small company based in Argentina called Building Ideas by Software On The Road. A team of six individuals was contracted to work on our smart contract, the entire ERC-721 layout, web development, security, 3D implementation, much more. Community Team There is not an NFT collection that's successful without its community & following. For this, we have brought in a team of capable individuals who have experience managing NFT collections, discord communities, and general service support. We want to provide you with the best experience throughout this incognito journey. Every Incognito collector is part of something much bigger, a family, movement, vision, and more. Media & Content Creation All our content creation, media, and marketing are handled by Eden Media Group. This is a media & marketing agency based out of the Dominican Republic. The team has experience working with both local & international companies handling all types of needs that range from social media to cinematography productions. We decided to go the extra step and make sure all of our content was taken care of by professionals. 3D Designs & Artwork All incognitos were designed by Nuxer.inc led by Nuxer, a self-taught 3D Artist and creative junkie with tremendous skills and passion. If there is one thing you will be amazed by in this collection, it's the amazing 3D models created by Leo. Over 500+ hours and two months of work went into the creation of all our artwork. The final result is an amazing combination of quality, attractiveness, and overall amazing 3D models. Web Design Our web design was done by Happy2Host, a Web Design & Development Agency based in London. Their portfolio is filled with amazing work produced for top artists, companies, athletes, and institutions all around the world. They will be part of the Incognito family for the long run as we keep improving our website and start working on the next steps of this project.

To enter this giveaway, you must own an Incognito that has the ""ICON Chain"" attribute Opportunity Unique opportunity to be part of something special! The Problem The NFT community has been pouring millions into projects that have no real foundation or team with the professional experience to guide a multi-million dollar project. Additionally and rather unfortunately, other NFT collections often involve very poor artistic value. All of this means: Collection dies off in a couple of days or weeks Some people make money with quick flips but long-term holders aren't rewarded Most NFT Collections have been lacking artistic value and quality Many individuals are taking advantage of this community hype, resulting in quick money schemes instead of real NFT projects with a long-term vision We believe this community is forgetting what NFTs should represent, pouring money into things that have no future value. We can and should do better as a community in general. Opportunity There is an incredible opportunity in the NFT community to create something that can be seen as an industry standard and change the way collections of this type are viewed. By building both a collection and a team that's focused on quality and real artistic value, we are hoping to create a brand that will be part of NFT history. The Incognito collection is just the first of many different projects we have planned for the future of Dyn Studios. NFT Ownership Intellectual Property Consumer Agreement This Intellectual Property Consumer Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement”) is made by and between Dyn Studios and the purchaser of an Incognito (ICON) from Minter (the “Purchaser” or “You” or “Your”). This Agreement becomes effective at the time you purchase an ICON. If you do not agree with any of the terms in this Agreement, your only recourse is to refrain from purchasing an ICON. 1) ICONs. The Minter has created or otherwise obtained all intellectual property rights to various different bases, characteristics, and attributes (each an “Attribute”), which will be randomly combined to create each ICON (for example, earings, eyes, hats, neck, body, face, mouth, and material attributes, and/or the like). No two ICON will comprise the same combination of Attributes. The collection consists of 10,000 randomly generated and unique ICONs living on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 tokens. Ownership includes full intellectual & commercial rights to your specific ICONs. Ownership. You will fully own Your purchased ICONs, as originally provided by Minter (Your “Purchased ICON”). In response to the Purchaser paying the price of a ICON upon initial release, Minter hereby sells, assigns, and transfers to Purchaser all right, title, and interest in and to Your Purchased ICON, and all intellectual property rights solely in the specific, complete combination of all Attributes included in Your Purchased ICON. As Purchaser will understand, one or more Attributes included in Your Purchased ICON will be included in one or more other ICON provided or sold to other purchasers. Accordingly, Purchaser cannot receive, and does not receive, any intellectual property rights in individual Attributes included in the Purchased ICON, or in any combination of Attributes other than the specific, complete combination of all Attributes included in Your Purchased ICON. Therefore, Minter retains all intellectual property rights in each Attribute, and in any combinations thereof, except to the specific, complete combination of all Attributes in Your Purchased ICON conveyed to You herein. 3.

Goons of Balatroon,9700,3200,0.17,3100,"Whitepaper November 2021 Edition TABLE OF CONTENTS Executive Summary 02 Introduction 04 Monetary Policy 07 Game Economy 11 Development Roadmap 17 Disclaimer 19 1 Goons of Balatroon (GOB) is a universe powered by digital assets that engage and empower users through digital ownership and economic activity. A blockchain-based trading card game is at the center of this universe, where players battle with wacky and quirky cards. The humorous nature of the cards is very much a reflection of the loose and fun nature of the Balatroon fantasy universe. It is a place that aims to offer an immersive in-game environment that transcends gaming. The game is built with Unity and uses Ethereum technology to allow players to own in-game Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that are usable and functional within the gaming framework. These digital assets give their owners the power to earn further rewards, distributed by automated systems that hold real-world value. Alternatively, the assets can be sold in NFT marketplaces. All players can access the play-to-earn aspect of the game, but owning and bringing into play a digital identity in the form of a Goon NFT guarantees superior $GOB token rewards EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2 and access to premium features. Goons are characters that roam the lands of Balatroon and represent the primary digital asset layer. They battle each other using non-NFT and NFT based cards, which serve as the second digital asset layer. NFT-based cards are rarer, more desirable, and are essential to creating powerful decks. $GOB token is the in-game currency that fuels the game economy and serves as the platform utility. Players can earn $GOB by simply playing the game or leasing their Goon NFT to other players and sharing their game rewards. Additionally, users may opt to stake their $GOB in the staking protocol and receive additional tokens as a reward for stabilizing the economy. Users can choose to use $GOB or $ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, to purchase card packs, craft new NFT cards, in-game purchase add-ons, and enter into lease agreements with Goons NFT holders to experience the gaming world more affordably. However, using $GOB as a payment method will guarantee a discounted price. The above features are built on the Ethereum Blockchain while using Immutable X as a layer 2 solution. Immutable X offers zero gas fees, instant trades, and scalability, which are all important to creating a seamless and accessible gaming experience. Zero gas fees Instant trades Scalability 3 Goons of Balatroon is a virtual world where players can own a Goon and use it to engage in strategic battles with a carefully crafted deck of cards. It is a place where players can choose to join either the Bulas or the Bairs faction and find the Goon that is right for them as they navigate through the challenges presented by the elements on the battlefield. Earn $GOB rewards for winning battles, or stake the tokens for further rewards and have a say in the future of the GOB gaming world. The game economy set up by GOB will feature an autonomous rewards pool structure to enable individual transactions without oversight. This paper will explore the conceptual underpinnings of the GOB economic ecosystem and outline how the $GOB token will interact with the world’s services, characters, and items (NFTs). The goal is for the reader to be introduced to the various DeFi mechanisms and methodologies used to bridge the NFT layer through $GOB. The token itself is designed for in-game mechanics, and thus, the underlying fact is that 1 $GOB = 1 $GOB, always. INTRODUCTION The game uses Ethereum technology to provide unique mechanics that allow players to be part of the game beyond the traditional and flawed playing models existing in the gaming industry. Players can have real ownership and full control of in-game digital assets, such as Goon Characters, Goon Cards, and items used for customization purposes. Player empowerment doesn’t stop here, as players can also take direct ownership of the game through a revenue-sharing model facilitated by token staking with an automated rewards system. A sustainable economic environment is created by flipping the power structure, taking control away from the publishers, and allowing players to drive and dictate the game’s direction. This model promotes interaction and engagement and ultimately incentivizes users to participate actively in the gameplay and economy. Being Part of The Game 4 Digital assets such as Goon Characters, Goon Cards, and customization items are an essential and integral part of the game itself. Although such assets are not a prerequisite to playing the game and being part of the community, players can evolve and grow with the game using the NFT enhancements that increase their engagement and advance their playing level. Integrating Functional NFTs into Gameplay The GOB universe is controlled by characters called Goons. Owning a Goon differentiates the player during battles, guarantees superior play-to-earn rewards, and gives access to add-ons such as Goon Bods. 1. Goon Characters 2. Goon Bods The Goon Characters, also known as Goon Avatars, are only visually presented as a headpiece. Players can exude their ideal style in the game by customizing the body of their avatar through a second NFT called Goon Bods. Each body enhancement also carries a unique in-game animation, such as a finishing move or dance. The winning player’s character triggers the animation at the end of the battle. 3. Goon Cards All players get access to a free base card pool that is not considered a digital asset. It allows players to play the game, understand it, and decide if they wish to enhance their card deck to be more competitive. NFT-based Goon Cards are more desirable and powerful, enhance battle strategies, and add the important functional aspect of ownership into the gameplay. 5 The ownership of Goon NFTs unlocks full economic access to the game, but there are alternatives for potential players to enter the game world more affordably. New players can either lease a Goon NFT or even play the game without any NFTs. For the latter, a user can launch the game and access a pool of default, free non-NFT playing cards. They can now battle any player and become eligible to claim $GOB for in-game upgrades or new cards. Although this free path to the game is there to be used, the $GOB rewards earned from battles will be a fraction of what Goon NFT owners generate. An alternative is thus offered to players to lease Goons from other players and, in turn, satisfy that requirement and earn the maximum token rewards. These alternative access paths enable user growth while protecting Goons NFT holders’ benefits. Enabling User Growth Immutable X (IMX) is a scaling solution that allows players to grow within the GOB ecosystem by significantly decreasing transactional fees incurred during the buying and selling of NFTs. Deploying GOB assets onto IMX ensures that it is affordable for any user to engage in a digital transaction without worrying about high transactional costs associated with the Ethereum Scaling the System with Immutable X blockchain. This move to a gasless or free-trade system will create higher activity levels for deck building and buying cards on the buying and selling markets. User engagement is highly valuable to create a sustainable ecosystem. Using this solution will create a foundation through which high participation rates on the market can be created and bring more economic opportunities for new players and traders. Combined with speed and affordability, this model solves a layered solution for deployment at a mass level to facilitate mass adoption of the GOB ecosystem. 6 MONETARY POLICY The $GOB token is the governance and rewards token of the Goons of Balatroon universe. $ETH is added to the ecosystem as another currency to acquire in-game assets and pay for in-game activities and other necessary game functions. The value of $GOB will come from the sustainability and expansion of the game economy. 7 $GOB has a fixed supply of 750,000,000 tokens, which will be allocated as follows: Liquidity Private / Seed GROUP Play-to-Earn Rewards Staking Rewards Ecosystem Team Public Sale 2.5% 14.66% %ALOC 35% 18.5% 13% 15% 1.33% 18,750,000 110,000,000 $GOB ALOC 262,500,000 138,750,000 97,500,000 112,500,000 10,000,000 100% TGE 16 months linear vesting, 4 month cliff / 12 months linear vesting, 2 month cliff 72 month linear vesting Exponential decay unlock 24 month linear vesting 24 month linear vesting - 6 months cliff 6 months linear vesting VESTING PERIOD - 12% end of cliff, 22% quarterly for 12 months / 10% end of cliff, 9% monthly for 10 months daily emissions - 5% TGE, daily emissions 10% end of cliff, 5% monthly for 18 months 10% TGE, 15% monthly for 6 months VESTING TERMS 8 The play-to-earn rewards pool is the key driver of the game economy and so is assigned the largest distribution allocation of 262,500,000 tokens. The gaming rewards attract players to join the ecosystem and incentivize them to play an active role by playing the game, trading digital assets, and participating in various gaming activities that support the economy. Rewards from the pool will be distributed to the players through regular daily rewards, tournaments, special events, and missions. These rewards are based on an autonomous system where the GOB team has no control of the distribution of tokens. Play-to-Earn Rewards A large part of the Goons of Balatroon metaverse, is the community members, NFT owners, game players, fans, investors, and creators. 150,000,000 tokens are allocated to this pool to initiate, facilitate, and support community engagement to deepen and strengthen the relationship and trust between GOB and the community. The tokens will be used for community tournament rewards, design contests, referrals, growth projects, and increasing the governance and engagement of the community. Ecosystem 138,750,000 tokens are allocated into two staking reward pools to be later distributed between the stakers of $GOB tokens and GOB NFTs. 112,500,000 tokens will be channeled into the staking pool that rewards $GOB stakers. This initial pool contribution will kickstart the staking protocol rewards before the economy fully functions with self-sustaining gamingrelated inflows. The remaining 26,250,000 tokens are put into the staking pool that rewards NFT stakers. NFT stakers are defined as anyone who simply has not listed their digital assets on 3rd party marketplaces. This allows Goon owners to earn $GOB tokens on their NFT before game release. In both cases, the distribution of tokens will be controlled through a reward-based exponential decay strategy that rewards early contributors with a higher emission rate. The distribution of tokens is done through an automated system without any influence from the GOB team. Staking Rewards Pools 9 112,500,000 tokens will be allocated to the GOB team to support technical development, executive management, and partnerships. The tokens will unlock over 24 months after a 6-month cliff. Team 75,000,000 tokens will be reserved to provide market liquidity to decentralized exchanges. The tokens will be instantly released upon TGE. Liquidity 105,000,000 tokens will be reserved for a private sale. Information regarding the allocation of tokens towards public and private sales will be available at a future date. $GOB token is not an investment vehicle, and the GOB team cannot make any promises regarding future value. Private Sale 15,000,000 tokens will be reserved for a public sale. Information regarding the allocation of tokens towards public and private sales will be available at a future date. $GOB token is not an investment vehicle, and the GOB team cannot make any promises regarding future value. Public Sale 10 GAME ECONOMY Goons Battle is a free-to-play game that provides an optional premium economic layer where players collect digital assets, receive higher gaming rewards, and access features that enhance the gaming experience. The game economy is sustained through natural cash flows that include fees from gaming-related activities as inflows and carefully balanced rewards from gaming and staking activities as outflows. The game economy can be broken into five modules that work together to create a circular and sustainable economy: Stakeholders Base Pools Exchange Inflow Channels Outflow Channels 11 12 The base pools contain tokens funded through either economic activities or a monetary policy and are fundamental in supporting DeFi mechanisms. Base Pools Vault: The Vault is a pool responsible for creating the buying pressure of the $GOB token and facilitating token rewards to stakers. The pool receives $ETH through certain inflow channels. An automated and parametric system then facilitates the purchase of $GOB tokens on the open market to replenish the tokens held by the Staking Pool. While GOB will control the Vault and establish its structure at the start, the system is built in a way that enables a future transition to a fully-decentralized economy where users vote on decisions that will shape the game going forward. Staking Rewards Pool: Game Rewards Pool: $GOB gets accumulated in the Staking Pool from the vault and is then distributed among all stakers in the system using the Staking Protocol. Users will be able to visualize their stake and anticipated rewards in a dynamic way. The Game Rewards Pool contains tokens that reward players for participating in battles. Unlike the Vault and Staking Rewards Pool, tokens The two stakeholders in the GOB ecosystem are the community and GOB Foundation. All economic inflow activities originate from the community, and all economic outflow activities move into the community’s hands. GOB Foundation receives some of the inflow generated by the community as revenue streams. As always, 1 $GOB equals 1 $GOB. Stakeholders 13 All $ETH that gets accumulated in the Vault will eventually flow to the Staking Rewards Pool. However, since the pool only distributes staking rewards in $GOB, this requires $ETH to be first exchanged to GOB’s native token. This process will ensure a consistent buying pressure of the $GOB token and will be one of the main drivers of the token’s stability. Exchange The inflow channels are created from fee-based economic transactions that provide value to the community. The inflow of fees gets channeled to either the Vault or the GOB Foundation. Fees sent to the Vault eventually get distributed to stakers in the system as a reward for contributing to the network. In contrast, fees sent to the foundation are used for technical and executive development and represent the revenue streams for the GOB team. Inflow Channels GOB Foundation Inflows Goon Store: Goon Character NFT The Goon Store will offer the community new Goon NFT factions for sale in addition to the original Bear and Bull Goon character NFTs. The new factions will come into play as the ecosystem and community grow. The original two factions only feature 9,696 characters, so the number will be expanded as the game matures. in this pool are assigned by the monetary policy. Gamers receive rewards according to their ranking and whether or not they own a Goon NFT. Goon owners are eligible for the maximum rewards per battle, while freemium gamers receive rewards at a far smaller scale. 14 Vault Inflows Goon Store: Goon Card Packs Goon Card pack sales from the Goon Store are considered to be the primary Vault inflow. The packs are released in series, and each contains 5 NFT-based cards that can be common, rare, epic, or legendary. The NFTbased cards help players increase their odds of winning battles by having special abilities that create a strategically superior and robust deck. Crafting Stations Players can use Crafting Stations to improve their decks by generating new and better cards through crafting. Players interact with this process by inputting multiple undesirable duplicate cards, paying a fee, and receiving a rarer, more desirable card in return. The crafting fee gets sent to the Vault. Goon Factory Players can upgrade and customize their avatars through the Goon Factory by minting a Goon Bod - a full-body extension of the avatar-based Goons NFTs. Goon Bods visualize the humor and quirkiness of the Goons to the fullest. The Factory will expand into various other functions for players to build onto their characters and showcase them to others in the game. Premium upgrades and customizations carry a fee that gets sent to the Vault. Secondary Market Goon Card NFTs and Goon Character NFTs sold on secondary markets have royalty options of 2.5% built into the sales function on Opensea and are planned with future layer-2 integrations across marketplaces like Immutable X. 15 NFT Leasing NFT Leasing is an innovation on top of the ability to rent out NFTs and earn tokens. Goons NFT holders will have the option to lease out their assets to new players and share in the token rewards those players accumulate while playing the game for the agreed-upon lease contract duration. The lessee enters into a leasing contract with the lessor and receives full access to the game and the right to receive the maximum gaming rewards as any other Goon holder would. In turn, lessors earn the fee, with a small portion of that fee being sent to the Vault. The outflow channels originate from the Game or Staking Reward Pools and are distributed to the community through the pools’ respective protocols. The community can receive these rewards by either playing the game or staking the $GOB token. The Gaming and Staking Protocols control the reward outflow in a way that maintains a balanced in-game economy and ensures enough incentive for particular groups of activities. Outflow Channels Staking Protocol Users can stake $GOB tokens in the staking platform and, in turn, receive rewards from the Staking Pool. Rewards are proportionally allocated to all stakers weekly. Eventually, this mechanism will morph into a governance system where stakers can vote on development decisions and influence the game’s future. Gaming Protocol Users can earn $GOB tokens by engaging in battles in the trading card game. Rewards are allocated to both NFT and non-NFT owners, but players that own Goon NFTs are guaranteed significantly higher rewards. 16 DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP Website Upgrade Unify the styling and utilities of the GOB Brand Goon Card Packs Claim and sale process of Goon Card Pack NFTs starts on Immutable X Layer 2 Project Launch Goons of Balatroon is launched with the sale of 9,969 Goon avatar character NFTs Goon Factory A tool is launched where Goon holders can mint a Goon Bod NFT for their avatar NFT Delisting Protocol Goon Avatar and Bod NFT holders can accumulate $GOB rewards by delisting their assets from marketplace 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 17 Game Launch Play-to-earn event launch celebration!

Notwithstanding the $GOB distribution, users have no economic or legal right over or beneficial interest in the assets of the Company, the Distributor, or any of their affiliates after the token distribution. To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading $GOB does develop, it would be run and operated wholly independently of the Company, the Distributor, the distribution of $GOB and Goons of Balatroon.

PXQuest,5000,3100,0.278,2800,"SUSPICIOUS MONKEY STUDIOS PXQUEST WHITEPAPER V1.1 PUBLIC RELEASE INTRO WHAT IS PXQUEST? WHAT DO WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE? THE PLOT IN 72.1 WORDS ADVENTURER NFTs GAMEPLAY RAIDING DUELING KINGDOM BUILDING SUMMONING $CHRONOS WHAT IS $CHRONOS? EARNING $CHRONOS SMARTER, CHEAPER ARCHITECTURE HAVING YOUR CAKE AND EATING IT TOO GASLESS RAIDING ON-CHAIN META RANDOMISATION FAIR AND TRANSPARENT SALE INTRO WHAT IS PXQUEST? PXQuest is an NFT dungeon crawler, in which every character, piece of loot and plot of land are ERC721 tokens owned by the players. The game consists of four core activities: ? Raiding/Dungeons/Questing ? Dueling ? Kingdom Building ? Summoning New Adventurers WHAT DO WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE? We want PXQuest to be a completely free to play experience after the initial NFT purchase. This means no gas or hidden fees to play the game to its fullest extent. For those with an investor mindset, we also want to deliver assets that grow in value over time and can be traded on the largest marketplaces. This paper provides a brief explanation of how we have balanced these often competing interests with a novel blend of technologies and game mechanics. THE PLOT IN 72.1 WORDS PXQuest adventurers are all that remain of once great kingdoms destroyed by a collapse in time in space. A calamitous war left most land in fractured time - uninhabitable by organic lifeforms. With the recent discovery of $CHRONOS crystals, these survivors can now stabilise time to reclaim land and summon objects and beings from the past. All that was lost can be regained … if new rivalries don’t get in the way … 5000 UNIQUE artworks 8CLASSES 5RACES GAMEPLAY RAIDING Players form raiding parties of increasing size to take on quests, dungeons and raids of increasing difficulty and reward. Defeated mobs will drop weapons, armour, and resources for kingdom building. Equipable drops will increase stats and victory odds for the characters assigned them. All drops are NFTs in their own right that can be traded independently on common marketplaces like OpenSea. DUELING On-chain dueling between players can be used to settle scores and wagers. Players can wager $CHRONOS, items, resources and more. Adventurer level, equipped items and choice of attack contribute to increasing the statistical odds of victory. The final outcome of duels is transparently determined on-chain where all can verify its authenticity and fairness. KINGDOM BUILDING Land PXQuest Adventurers own land and join lands to form a kingdom. Land is minted on the Ethereum Mainnet, however structures built on land are minted on our layer 2 solution. There are just 500 plots of land in PXQuest, comprised of two categories: ? Time-fractured land (450 plots) - unstable land that requires 1250 $CHRONOS crystals to stabilise and mint before anything can be built upon it. ? Stable Land (50 plots) - time-stabilised plots that are ready to build upon immediately. These are unique 1:1 plots that will be auctioned for Ether prior to launch of the land system. Before a plot is stabilised (purchased) with $CHRONOS the type of terrain is unknown. Different terrains, and different combinations of adjacent terrain, will give land different production abilities, stats and appearance. What do I do with land? There are several benefits to owning land: ? Accumulating resources & alliances ? Minting better gear for your raiders ? Unlocking larger dungeon raids ? Titles and Skins Accumulating Resources & Alliances Resources or raw materials are the foundations for kingdom building and crafting in PXQuest. Land plots yield layer 2 resources on a daily basis - depending on the terrain type. At the time of minting land, the player also specifies in the same transaction which Kingdom they wish to join. All landowners in the kingdom receive an increased resource yield based on the number of lands that are part of the kingdom. Minting / Crafting Gear During raiding adventurers will obtain resources they can use to develop structures on their land such as blacksmiths, markets and stables. These structures can be used by any kingdom citizen to convert resources and items into superior items (armour, weapons, consumables used in raiding). In other words, a strong kingdom produces rare non-character NFTs for players. Raid Unlocks Dungeons in PXQuest come in different sizes with the best loot obtainable in the largest raids/dungeons. To participate in raids of a certain size you must be a citizen of a kingdom with a certain number of structures built. Structures Kingdom Level Max Raid Size 0 N/A 5 3 inc. Guild Hall Shire 10 5 inc. Trading House County 20 10 inc. Citadel Kingdom 50 Titles & Skins Land owners receive special titles and skins visible in game because they are after all… royalty! I have no land! What about me? PXQuest reflects a true feudal system in that the majority of players are landless. Landless players can however be invited to become the citizen of a kingdom, which entitles them to certain benefits. Citizens can: 1. Join raids of the size unlocked by their Kingdom 2. Contribute their resources to assist development of structures in the Kingdom 3. Use Kingdom structures like blacksmiths to mint rare items for themselves 4. Join private discord channels for their Kingdom. 5. Do whatever else your Kingdom decides to build its community! SUMMONING Aside from land purchases, the other key use of $CHRONOS is summoning new NFT adventurers. With 750 $CHRONOS crystals and the blood of two Gen 1 adventurers, a player can summon an ancestor from the past. The race of the summoned Gen 2 ancestor is determined by the particular race combination of the two summoning adventurers. On Top of this there is no hard cap on race variety out of the Gen2 collection. This essentially means Generation 1 holders will determine the rarity of Gen2 races by what races they choose to breed. However, summoning does not stop there… TOP SECRET ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________REDACTED___________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________ $CHRONOS WHAT IS $CHRONOS? $CHRONOS (aka Chronos Crystal) is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum Mainnet. that is required to perform summoning, evolving and reclaim time-fractured land. The $CHRONOS token only has value within the PXQuest game ecosystem (1 $CHRONOS = 1 $CHRONOS). The PXQuest developers have no plans to make a secondary market for $CHRONOS. EARNING $CHRONOS $CHRONOS crystals can be claimed at a rate of 5 per day (unclaimed $CHRONOS accrues) per adventurer held. $CHRONOS yields will take effect immediately after initial sale. SMARTER, CHEAPER ARCHITECTURE HAVING YOUR CAKE AND EATING IT TOO Despite the rise of technically viable alternatives, the primacy of Ethereum Mainnet NFT market is still undisputable - in terms of the number of market participants and value traded. However, steep Mainnet gas fees have prevented the growth of any substantively interactive on-chain gaming experiences. So how do we reconcile this tension - between mainnet NFTs being the most valuable, yet also the most expensive to interact with? Introducing our hybrid NFT architecture… HYBRID ASSET MODEL Mainnet Layer 2 We understand that players want the ability to trade their most valuable assets with the biggest markets, so your core ERC-721 NFTs are minted on the Ethereum Mainnet. ? Adventurers (all gens) ? Land Plots Additionally our ERC-20 currency is also most useful when used in conjunction with these assets on the mainnet: ? $CHRONOS Secondary items that are produced during gameplay are minted gas-free as ERC-721s on our layer 2 solution. ? Weapons ? Armour ? Productive Assets (Land Enhancements) ? Land Resources (Land Yield) Crucially - all Layer 2 NFTs are fully transferable to the Ethereum Mainnet, meaning if you believe they have market value you can trade them on marketplaces such as Opensea. GASLESS RAIDING Using our hybrid asset model players can raid and receive loot without needless burning ETH on gas fees. Interactions are instead limited only where it makes sense as a game mechanic to prevent speed running - such as raid level requirements, boss cooldowns and adventurer revival cooldowns. ON-CHAIN META RANDOMISATION FAIR AND TRANSPARENT SALE If you are reading this far it means that just maybe you care as much about doing things right as we do, and this begins at initial sale. Recent NFT launches have been dogged by claims of insider trading as developers had prior knowledge of the identity of the most valuable tokens during the sale process. To prevent any possibility of insider trading we have implemented an on-chain meta randomisation function that will be called immediately following initial sale. Anyone can see exactly when and how randomisation has occurred, and nobody, not even our developers have any way of knowing the outcome in advance.

We believe in the future of Web 3.0 and the Metaverse and want our Uninterested Unicorns to have a name and place as one of the original NFT projects that launched this year in 2021 during the up-trend of digital collectibles in general. The U_U name and brand was originally conceptualised by a group of artists led by Ryan Teo (Rynja), and is one of the leading artists of the NFT space today with the success of this early project in Uninterested Unicorns. Besides Ryan, the co-founding team also includes Terence Ting - who is Managing Director at NEX10 LABS which owns the Uninterested Unicorns brand through it’s newly created subsidiary, New Moon Studios. New Moon Studios also has Lim Keng Hin as our lead blockchain developer, and is largely an Asian co-founding team with our company based in Singapore. Mission To be a leading GameFI project, creating an enjoyable game experience with huge cultural influence in the general NFT space Through Unis, we aim to explore the longterm potential of NFTs and how they can fit into the wider idea of a Metaverse world, which bridges the physical and virtual reality gap TABLE OF CONTENTS TABLE OF CONTENTS $UNG P2E Token 23 • Token preview • Key features Project Uni (Game information) 24 • Summary / Introduction • Creative & Strategic objectives • Game Design & Modes • Victory Condition / Keys • Game units • $UCD and $UNG Tokens About Us 2 An Uninteresting Story 4 Project Info 5 • Roadmap • Official links • Team • Advisors $UCD Utility Token 9 • Tokenomics • Key features AN UNINTERESTING STORY AN UNINTERESTING STORY Being magical and cute got boring so the unicorns started fighting to bring excitement to their lives. But after a while even that wasn’t enough, so now they’re just uninterested and blasé, isolating themselves in Uni Land away from the rest of the metaverse. Once upon a time, there was a wonderful land filled with butterflies, rainbows and beautifully mystical unicorns. It was a Metaverse full of peace, friendship, and predictability. Fortunately, our story does not take place at that time. Because what kind of land could survive on these things alone? None, as it turns out. As the years went by, the unicorns started to change. The lack of spontaneity made them increasingly blasé. The friendships they made turned to ash once they realised how similar they all were. It didn’t take long for them to crave something different, something… dangerous. Or whatever could help pass the time and make their lives worth living, really. In the end, it seemed like conflict and self-promotion provided good reasons to be alive. The society of unicorns divided into different clans, each clan asserting dominance in one domain: fire, water, air, and earth. As they expected, creating such a monopoly over the elements of life resulted in friction between the clans, which soon led to wars. A pinch of vanity was key to pushing them over the edge and really making them feel that, actually, they were pretty awesome. Though rivalries were the norm, certain clans found themselves more invested in fighting each other than fighting for resources. A group of unicorns started seeing the others as competition, and delighted in finding ways to remove some of their power and use it for themselves. Piece by piece, they’d take away some of the light found in all unicorns. As the victims became increasingly darker, the thieves became increasingly purer, creating two new clans: the darks and the pures. They’re pretty easy to spot, you’ll see. After decades of feuds and narcissism, the current generation of clans consists of Uninterested Unicorns. What once brought passion, skill and reward is now met with a quick judgmental glance and a shrug. In fact, the unicorns have secluded themselves in the Grand Valley, where they can be free to be their uninterested selves without the whining of the other members of the Metaverse. Why bother with basic matters, right? The unicorns became practically impossible to reach, and it is even said that the purest of the Uninterested Unicorns live in a majestic castle and haven’t been seen in years… The Uninterested Unicorns of the Grand Valley are the stuff of legends. Despite this, each clan goes about their lives, completely numb to the events that take place within the Metaverse. That is, unless something seemingly interesting finally happens.

One thing to note is that when Unis are sent on a Quest in groups according to clans/rarity/longer lengths, they are able to earn an increased $UCD farming % to their overall yield. As of today, we have allocated around 125,000,000 $UCD tokens for Questing over the next 5 years (25,000,000 $UCD / year distributed through Questing). Any remaining tokens from Questing will be reallocated back to our Foundation Reserves or the P2E economy, which will be decided in the future as the project progresses and we monitor the state of our token economy and where best to allocate our Questing token balance to.

We would like to stress that our $UCD Token on it's own, is only a utility token which can be used in the Uninterested Unicorns ecosystem (Game, Metaverse, Website DAPP etc) and has no monetary or economic value – and should be treated solely as such. There is no promised passive income or revenue generation from owning this Token, in any way, shape or form. 4 2 0 FEATURE $UCD creates Uni Council token $UCD creates Uni Council token Access to Governance + secret Uni utility in the future 5 Governance will be a key aspect of our U_U ecosystem.

Voxel Ville Official,4300,1700,0.37,1900,"This roadmap outlines our goals and where we want to take Voxel Ville Voxel Ville Roadmap V1 Voxel Ville will continue the rollout of our remaining plots in quantities of 250-750 plots per collection. The rollout is ongoing until we sell out 7777 plots in total. We are currently in the process of building our metaverse on our very own plot of NFT Worlds land – this will enable our community to meet in live time to socialise and play a variety of mini-games to win prizes! A place called home. Your plot will be converted over by our Minecraft builders, and integrated into our very own NFT World land. So check out where your plot(s) are in the metaverse and visit your neighbours! Voxel Ville will adopt a utility token for our NFT Worlds metaverse – this token will allow all holders to purchase upgrades for their property, tickets for in-game events and customisable wearables for their avatars – and much more! P2E Gaming – Voxel Ville will implement mechanisms for players to earn our native utility token by playing games in Voxel Ville. Furthermore, we will regularly hold competitions and host free to play games that allow you to earn whilst playing. We will introduce an in-game Voxel Ville marketplace where you can buy items to customise your plot! So get into metaverse real estate and build the best house on the block, or choose to fill your garage with the latest sports cars from the dealership to race around the Voxel Ville Raceway! Voxel Ville will provide constant building and updates to the metaverse, regularly introducing new features, games, and community events. We will continue to mint all of our collections by allowlist only. The allowlist is granted through unique mini-games set exclusively in the Voxel Ville Metaverse and announced in our Discord. We are in the process of carefully planning a ‘Voxel Ville Avatar’ collection. This will allow our residents to mint a completely unique voxel avatar which can be used inside the metaverse to express themselves in an entirely unique way. There is currently no ETA on this launching. Voxel Ville Roadmap V2 We are currently working on a second stage to our current roadmap. Version 2 will include some huge fundamental changes and additions to our current roadmap, and we can’t wait to bring this to life. Coming late Q1 with a website revamp. Team The Voxel Ville founders VoX Founder Hamu3l? Founder BlueAngel812 Architect / Builder notgenius Lead Developer Unnamed Developer Yeet Game Developer Featured Voxel Villes Each plot is uniquely designed Frequently asked questions We have answered the most frequent question? How much is a Voxel Ville NFT (plot)? The Voxel Ville plots cost 0.05 ETH per plot. Where can I mint a Voxel Ville NFT? You can mint a Voxel Ville NFT on our website; click here to get brought to the mint section. How many Voxel Ville NFTs will there be? There will be a total of 7,777 Voxel Ville NFTs. How do I mint a Voxel Ville NFT? Head to the mint section of our website, connect your MetaMask, and click mint! Why are there no NFTs left to mint? Due to the nature of how our NFTs get made, we drop them in batches/collections. Every collection or drop has 250 – 1000 unique plots. We regularly post updates for dates and times of when the following collection will happen. What is the utility and functionality of a Voxel Ville NFT? Voxel Ville is a progressive Metaverse in which you can establish (mint) a plot of virtual land. Holding onto this land will allow you to have several utilities yet to be published – however, some are detailed below. Free airdrops of Voxel Ville characters and Voxel Ville public spaces – if you’re lucky enough to mint a plot with some residents, you’ll be airdropped with a more detailed design from the characters in your NFT under another collection. A place called home. Your plot will be on a live feed of a map you can see other residents living in too. Send a friendly message to your neighbors or even a cheeky offer for their plot! Automatically enrolled into our beta program with the ability to customise your NFT after minting (the original NFT on OpenSea will stay the same but will be customisable on another platform – all properties on the other platform will exchange to the next NFT holder when you/if you come to sell) Physical 3D prints of your plot sent to your Amazon locker or PO Box (made for free and posted for free for the early settler role). AR and VR implementation with the ability to explore your plots. What is the future of Voxel Ville? The future is bright. The end is Voxel Ville. The Voxel Ville team will be aiming to develop a video game in which all players (holders) can interact with one another, collect points, and complete quests. A video game where everyone can utilise their plot, own a pet, build a farm, drive around and contribute to the town and community is something we would love to see and aim to deliver. When is the next Voxel Ville drop? Please keep an eye on our #announcements Discord channel to see when the next drop is! What is an NFT? NFT stands for “Non-fungible token,” which means that it’s a unique, digital item with blockchain-managed ownership that users can buy, own, and trade. Some NFT’s fundamental function is to be digital art. But they can also offer additional benefits like exclusive access to websites, event tickets, game items, and ownership records for physical objects. Think of it as a unique piece of art that can also work as a “members-only” card. Voxel Ville works like this. How do I get an NFT? New to NFTs? No worries, here are some steps on what you need to do to get your Voxel Ville. Download the metamask.io extension for the Chrome/Brave browser or app on mobile. This will allow you to make purchases with Ethereum and can be found in the extensions tab. If you are on mobile, you must use the Metamask App Browser. You can purchase Ethereum through the Metamask Wallet using Wyre or Send Ethereum from an exchange like Coinbase. Click on Connect MetaMask at the top of the page and connect your Metamask. Once joined, you will be able to purchase the NFTs in the mint section. You will be prompted to sign your transaction. FYI, there will be a fee associated with every transaction related to gas prices. Once you have made your purchase, your Voxel Ville NFTs will be viewable in your wallet and on OpenSea."

Behind the pseudonym, we ignore who Satoshi really is or was; for all we know he could be a carpenter, a janitor or even a corporation, amongst the World Elite. His legacy need only speak for itself. So too, the ancient Samurai often lead a simple selfless life according to the Bushido code of Modesty, Frugality, Benevolence and Honor, sharing much in common with Satoshi Nakamoto in higher service to society as a whole. Our artist, Hisoka Gaka (????) follows the same path of these influences; with a desire to express his art in its purest form, away from bias tied to his real identity. Hisoka can be one of the greatest artists in the world, or just a housekeeper. With this question, one can see if the art is enough to give you the answer and to elevate this project to the recognition it truly deserves. ""The Floating World"" Living in the moment, detached from the bothers of life. Ukiyo (U-key-yo) - Japanese Project 3333 is a NFT project of 3,333 ERC721 unique artworks stored on the Ethereum Blockchain. It is a celebration of Japanese Culture and Art. The Artist has picked various different references from Japanese history and has created an hommage collection for everyone to enjoy and savour. Our Art has references to classic artwork to everyone’s favourite Miyazaki and Kurosawa movie or your nostalgic childish anime series. Hisoka Gaka has allied with professional Blockchain and Marketing/PR companies based in Asia to ensure the project's longevity. Our team of experts developed a proprietary AI-algorithm that splits each of the artist's attributes into various components. Those components are then selected randomly by the generative software to create concoctions, each one a unique NFT portraying the artist's work. Hisoka also strived to bring a distinctive aesthetic quality to the art. Our exceptionally talented artist has spent months creating this body of work, spending hours at a time working on each of the finer details. The authenticity of the classic Ukiyo-e style was respected whilst also referencing popular contemporary styles of Japanese digital media. What is Project 3333? At the Crossroads between Innovation and Aesthetics P R O J E C T 3 3 3 3 P R E S E N T E D B Y H I S O K A G A K A Samurais Exclusive Club Great projects do not base their growth solely on hype or paid influencer promotion. Their focus is on establishing a consensus and fostering serious relationships with their most engaged holders. We believe that this path is crucial to our development and that is why we have created the Samurai Exclusive Club : A VIP Telegram group where the team will meet regularly with the top collectors as well as those most passionate and engaged from the community. Such investors will often have a breadth of experience, connections and useful skills to help strengthen the project and allow us to deliver further on our goals. And, as custodians of the artwork and guardians of the project, it is of utmost importance that all our VIPs share the vision and feel like their voices are being heard. Caring for our most important holders P R O J E C T 3 3 3 3 P R E S E N T E D B Y H I S O K A G A K A Presale (4:30PM EST) NFTs at 0.15 ? Public Sale (5PM EST) NFTs at 0.25 ? LAUNCH PROTOCOL We are taking cautious steps in order to ensure the project is progressing well. As such, we will be launching according to the following protocol: 3RD Dec 3RD Dec How will the sale work? Those of who have met the requirements for the presale will be able to validate your whitelist spots in the exclusive sale & given direct access to our VIP Samurai Club. Whitelist Mint - December 3rd 4:30PM EST : NFTs at 0.15 ETH available. Whitelisters can mint up-to 5 NFTs Max Per Whitelisted Address. PUBLIC MINT - December 3rd 5:00PM EST : NFTs at 0.25 ETH. Public can mint up-to 10 NFTs Max Per Wallet Address Gas Wars have been a rampant issue with Ethereum-based NFTs. We have developed a multi-tiered presale system in order to prevent that from happening. Which will go as follows: We are using a voucher-based system to avoid gas fees for our minters. Instead of minting an NFT and paying a large amount for gas, you purchase a voucher which is stored on our smart contract. You pay for your 3333 NFTs when you buy the voucher, but you avoid the gas fees associated with minting, because gas fees will extend as we mint. To receive your 3333 NFT, you must use the Mint/Claim button on the website to mint your reserved 3333 NFT. If you don't own any vouchers, you cannot mint any 3333 NFTs. NOTE: PROJECT3333 IS RESERVING THE FIRST 111 MINTS TO GIVEAWAYS, FUTURE COLLABORATIONS AND CHARITY. Multi-tiered Presale system to prevent Gas Wars P R O J E C T 3 3 3 3 P R E S E N T E D B Y H I S O K A G A K A STAKING Once the primary sales are minted out, Staking will be our first general milestone. By providing a staking mechanism to our holders, we are building the very foundation towards a larger goal of keeping our community tight-knit as well as rewarding them through the longer term. The development of the functionalities of this first utility will be initiated with the consultation of the community, more details such as the numbers and protocol will also be disclosed post-launch. ROADMAP STAGE 1 STAGE 3 STAGE 4 DAO With the advent of Web3 taking on the old internet, it is essential to have a representation of our project within the space in order to positively transform it. Forming a DAO becomes natural as it will also be backed by our staking mechanism, as well as the creation of a governance system to vote officially on the decisions affecting our ecosystem. 3333 Manga Series We are proposing to release a manga series with the consultation of our community. This will reinforce the culture around our project and will incorporate story-lines voted and written by some of our community members as well. Sister Collection In an effort to provide more value to our art collectors, as well as growing our ecosystem and culture, we will be releasing a Sister collection once the current one has proven to be well established in the NFT space. The details of this collection will be put up to a community vote! STAGE 2 OUR COMMUNITY Great projects always come from great communities. It is with that founding pillar in mind that we are building Project3333. Our community is comprised of many resourceful individuals necessary to the development of the project and as such, we want to ensure that this community is empowered. This will go through a royalty distribution system that will go to a community vault, in order to support community-powered initiatives. Through a collective effort and a synergy of the most talented minds in the space, we can achieve more and build with longevity in mind. While we have general lines in where we want to head forwards, we will work alongside the community to build the utilities that our holders need. Building a community-centric project made for longevity 10.00% Royalties on Opensea 6.00% Of that 10% goes to a Community Vault to support Communityled initiatives.

Hungry Wolves,6000,1400,0.09,365,"Below are details behind the game mechanics of Hungry Wolves. Our team has worked tirelessly on this project and taken meaningful input from external advisors who are far smarter than ourselves, e.g. Scott Kominers, a tenured Harvard economist. The result is something that we believe will be extremely fun and while founded in the Ethereum blockchain, playable without significant gas fees. This document is broken into several sections: In each section we’ll discuss the mechanics, reasons why we made the decisions we did, as well as expected timelines for release. The Hungry Wolves mint launched in December 2021 and SOLD OUT on 1/6/22. It was separated into three phases, all of which were priced at 0.06 ETH. You can now purchase Hungry Wolves on the secondary market via OpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/hungry-wolves. Hungry Wolves NFT Examples MINT PHASE 1: 100% of the first 2,500 Hungry Wolves minted held an Alpha rank. MINT PHASE 2: 25% of the next 1,000 Hungry Wolves minted held an Alpha rank. The other 75% were Betas. MINT PHASE 3: 10% of the last 2,500 Hungry Wolves minted held an Alpha rank. The other 90% were Betas. These phases resulted in 3,000 Alphas and 3,000 Betas that became part of the overall collection. To be clear, despite their name, Beta wolves are not secondary members of our pack or community. They can do all of the same things as Alpha wolves. The trait pool is identical, they can join Wolfpacks, collect and eat sheep, earn Dominance and rewards. The one difference between Alpha and Beta wolves is their hunting prowess; Beta wolves retrieve smaller prey during regular airdrops. We’ll discuss this further in the Scrumptious Sheep & Lil Lamb Airdrops section. Alpha & Beta Logos Our NFTs each hold a metadata trait called Rank so you can easily identify if a wolf is an Alpha or Beta. This is also the foundation for wolves to be able to steal/swap ranks with each other using PVP mechanics, discussed later in the PVP section. There are 10 standard 1-of-1s included in our collection (one representing each of our 10 Wolfpacks) and 10 Werewolf Coins. Each were distributed at random during our mint. Werewolf Coin Holders of a Werewolf Coin have the ability to work with our 3D designers to transform it into a 1-of-1 custom Hungry Wolf based on their specifications. All 1-of-1s and Werewolf Coins initially hold the rank of Alpha. Hungry RUNTZ were announced in late-January 2022 as a “free-to-play” layer of the Hungry Wolves ecosystem. They are ERC-721 NFTs just like Hungry Wolves. You can learn more about RUNTZ at https://runtz.hungrywolvesnft.com. Hungry RUNTZ With an expected launch in February 2022, RUNTZ will be a completely FREE-TO-MINT (only pay gas) collection. RUNTZ are for everyone; especially those that are new to NFTs. The goal is to make them accessible to anyone who wants to explore the Hungry Wolves project and mechanics. With RUNTZ we are also introducing a new concept; an INFINITY MINT. There will be no collection cap with RUNTZ and the mint is designed to run forever. RUNTZ are meant to be perpetually available to anyone who wants to join the Hungry Wolves community. Hungry RUNTZ Beginning with Series 1, RUNTZ have hundreds of randomized traits creating millions of combinations. At a point in the future we will close Series 1 and launch Series 2 and so on. Each Series will have a unique trait pool; meaning new traits will be unveiled and some older ones, retired forever. RUNTZ with specific trait combinations may become rare collectables over time. RUNTZ are born into the world of Hungry Wolves. They can join Wolfpacks, eat sheep, earn Dominance, and even upgrade their visual traits. However, in most cases, RUNTZ must rely on their Hungry Wolves brothers & sisters for assistance due to their size. This is discussed further in the sections below. Once you acquire a Hungry Wolf or RUNTZ, you become eligible to join one of 10 Wolfpacks based on your NFTs unique traits. Hungry RUNTZ have a single trait (Fur) mapped to Wolfpacks and each is eligible to join a single pack. Hungry Wolves have a more complex mapping of traits as shown below and in most cases are eligible to join multiple packs. Wolfpacks Trait Map By entering The Wolf Den via our website, you can easily see which Wolfpacks each of your Hungry Wolves or RUNTZ are able to join. One of the big questions we’ve wrestled with: should joining a Wolfpack be “wolf” or “wallet” based? While our original plan was to allow all wolves to join Wolfpacks, regardless of how many one held in their wallet, we determined this created potential for significant imbalances as well as opportunities for players to cheat. Not to mention confusion and complexity for those holding large numbers of wolves. We decided the right path was to have our players (i.e. wallet holders) choose a single Wolfpack. We want each person to develop a genuine affinity for their chosen pack — like a guild or clan in an MMO. This simply isn’t possible if everyone can join multiple (or even all 10) simultaneously. When you enter The Wolf Den, you’re asked to choose a Primary Wolf from those available in your wallet. This Primary Wolf is then able to join a Wolfpack based on its unique traits. You can change your Primary Wolf, join, leave or switch Wolfpacks at anytime. While only one Hungry Wolf or Runt per wallet can formally join a Wolfpack, we’ve ensured that other game mechanics are designed in a way where it’s strategically advantageous to hold multiple. More on this in the sections below. Once your Primary Wolf joins a Wolfpack, a channel will unlock in our Discord allowing you to communicate and strategize with your packmates. Discord Wolfpack Channels This will be important when it comes time to compete and earn rewards with your Wolfpack; discussed below under the section Wolfpack Competitions. The Wolfpacks feature was released on 1/9/22. Beginning in January 2022, we began delivering monthly airdrops to all Hungry Wolves holders. Each month on the full moon IRL, Alpha wolves yield Scrumptious Sheep and Beta wolves, Lil Lambs. Important: Alpha and Beta wolves can eat both Scrumptious Sheep and Lil Lambs. Rank simply determines which variety each type “hunts” and therefore retrieves during airdrops. Hungry RUNTZ are too small to hunt on their own and therefore are not eligible to receive airdrops. However, they can eat Scrumptious Sheep & Lil Lambs if they acquire them via other means. This is discussed further in the Eating Your Sheep section below. Lil Lamb (Left) and Scrumptious Sheep (Right) During each airdrop, you’ll receive one Scrumptious Sheep or Lil Lamb for each Hungry Wolf in your wallet; but not all of them are the same. Some are rarer than others and as a result worth more Dominance when eaten. Scrumptious Sheep and Lil Lambs come in five varieties, each with an associated monthly drop rate: Scrumptious Sheep & Lil Lamb Rarity There are 10 different NFTs that can be acquired, each worth a scaling amount of Dominance when eaten. Think of it like a menu depending on how hungry you are! We’ll get into specifics of this in the next section. Before we go any further though, you should probably ask yourself if you have the constitution to eat this Mythical Lil Lamb. If the answer is no, you might have a hard time playing our game. Mythical Lil Lamb We’ve decided to make these 10 NFTs static; meaning the same 10 Scrumptious Sheep & Lil Lambs will be dropped month-over-month during regular airdrops. This is to ensure they’re easily visually identifiable and our OpenSea collection will always show 10 available NFTs for purchase vs. getting cluttered with potentially hundreds of extremely similar options. However, we know that many of our holders have been looking forward to “collecting” our sheep and having new visual traits available. Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. In addition to our regular monthly airdrops, we’re committing to doing at least one additional drop each month with a unique collectable NFT sheep designed by our team. These will be limited drops and never made available again in the future. Collectable drops will still be segmented by Alpha and Beta rank (Scrumptious Sheep vs. Lil Lamb) and will be edible, albeit for a significantly reduced amount of Dominance. In line with above, Hungry RUNTZ do not receive collectable drops. They are reserved exclusively for Hungry Wolves holders. Holiday Lil Lamb (Left) and Scrumptious Sheep (Right) Our team has launched two collections on OpenSea: Hungry Farm: Meant for eating. Reserved for the 10 static NFTs of varying rarity used in our standard monthly airdrops. Hungry Barn: Meant for collecting. Reserved for limited drops. You can view the traits of each NFT to view the amount of Dominance the NFT is worth when eaten. We know you’re all hungry. So when you eat a sheep, what happens? We mentioned above that there are 10 different potential options to receive in our regular monthly airdrops; 5 versions of Scrumptious Sheep for Alpha wolves and 5 versions of Lil Lambs for Beta wolves. Each based on its rarity is worth an increasing amount of Dominance when eaten. See the chart below. Scrumptious Sheep + Lil Lamb Dominance Chart *We reserve the right to adjust these figures in the future if we determine it necessary to balance game mechanics. Based on rarity levels, the end result is that Alpha wolves will receive a Scrumptious Sheep worth an average of 30 Dominance per month. Beta wolves will receive a Lil Lamb worth an average of 15 Dominance per month. While Hungry RUNTZ cannot hunt on their own, and therefore don’t receive their own airdrops, they can eat Scrumptious Sheep & Lil Lambs. In doing so RUNTZ receive 1/2 of the Dominance value compared to Hungry Wolves. As an example, if RUNTZ consume a Common Scrumptious Sheep, they earn 10 Dominance vs. the 20 listed in the chart above. Dominance will be a wallet based value — meaning as you eat your sheep, regardless of which Hungry Wolf or RUNTZ in your wallet consumes them, it all adds up to a singular value for the wallet holder. Dominance Logo If you consume sheep with your Primary Wolf, Dominance earned will also be mirrored and added to a total for your Wolfpack, creating the foundation of Wolfpack Competitions which is discussed below. Each Hungry Wolf in your wallet will be able to consume a maximum of three NFTs (either Scrumptious Sheep or Lil Lambs) per month before it becomes full. RUNTZ, due to their small size, can only consume one NFT per month. This was a BIG decision and implemented for a variety of reasons. Let’s talk through some examples and implications: If you hold a single Hungry Wolf in your wallet, you’ll earn one NFT during our monthly airdrop. You can acquire up to two more via buying/trading and can eat a maximum of three Scrumptious Sheep or Lil Lambs before you have to wait until the following month to consume more. This caps the amount of Dominance you can earn via eating each period. If you own more wolves, you can eat three NFTs with each of them during a period; significantly accelerating your wallet-based Dominance earnings. As an example if you own 6 wolves, you’d earn enough sheep during a single airdrop to fill up two of them, which can be done all at once. Since only one of your wolves can be your Primary Wolf and belong to a Wolfpack, it creates balance for Wolfpack Competitions, as each wallet can only eat three sheep per month that also benefit your Wolfpack. This creates incentives for your Primary wolf to consume rarer sheep and maximize Dominance that’s simultaneously attributed to your Wolfpack. TLDR: Owning more wolves will allow you to significantly accelerate your Dominance earnings, not only by receiving more sheep via airdrops, but being able to consume them more quickly within a single wallet. While technically you could mint large numbers of RUNTZ to accelerate Dominance earnings (due to them being free-to-mint) it would come at a high cost given they only yield 50% of the Dominance value to the wallet. All Scrumptious Sheep and Lil lambs are Polygon ERC-1155 tokens. There are two major benefits to using this token type: They’re “stackable” in the sense that if you own multiple, you’ll only have one token shown on your OpenSea profile along with a X owned counter. This is the same for when you visit OpenSea to purchase / sell sheep, or view your own wallet holdings. ERC-1155 Example They cost virtually nothing to transfer. Which means that when you eat, and therefore burn, the NFTs — gas fees should be extremely minimal. You’ll be able to enter The Wolf Den to see your wolf and sheep holdings, as well as eat them in bulk through a “shopping cart” like function. Dominance will then be immediately earned and available to spend. Our plan is to release functionality allowing you to eat your Scrumptious Sheep and Lil Lambs in Q1 2022. One of the major goals for our project is to create the ability for you to collaborate and compete alongside your packmates. Wolfpack Logos We shared above that: You choose a Primary Wolf from your wallet to join a Wolfpack. When you consume Scrumptious Sheep or Lil Lambs with your Primary Wolf, Dominance earned will be mirrored & attributed to your Wolfpack. Wolfpack competitions will be held on a monthly basis. At the beginning of each month, we’ll take a snapshot. If a wallet address has a Primary Wolf inside a Wolfpack on that date, that’s the pack their NFT will be a part of for purposes of competition and rewards, regardless of whether they switch their pack mid-month or sell their NFT. This is to prevent cheating. As a result, any newly acquired wolves will need to wait until a new monthly competition starts to participate. They’ll still be able to join packs and earn Dominance in the meantime — just not to support the existing competition. When we launch this feature, we’ll start with a simple binary goal for each Wolfpack: hit or miss. It will be to acquire X total Dominance for the month — scaled based on the membership size of each pack. If achieved, any Primary Wolf that contributes will receive a Dominance bonus for its holder. Hungry Wolves designated as Primary Wolves will receive 200 Dominance and RUNTZ designated as Primary Wolves, 100 Dominance. We’ll design the first goal to be extremely attainable, so the majority, if not all of the Wolfpacks will earn the reward. Once we observe the first competition, we’ll be able to set new bars (as well as multiple gates) for subsequent ones. We expect these competitions to evolve and incorporate different mechanics over time. We will also implement versions where only a certain number of Wolfpacks emerge victorious based on speed-to-goal or total. Each month will present new challenges. Our plan is to implement Wolfpack Competitions in late Q1 2022. PVP Challenges will only be for Hungry Wolves. They’re simply too dangerous for RUNTZ! There will be two types of PVP challenges in Hungry Wolves: Opposing Rank: Beta vs. Alpha Same Rank: Alpha vs. Alpha & Beta vs. Beta For Beta vs. Alpha challenges, there’s a grail at stake: the Rank metadata tag of the Alpha. If the Beta wins the challenge, the Beta wolf will BECOME the Alpha, and in turn, the Alpha will become the Beta. But with significant reward comes significant risk. Risk that the Alpha wolves can capitalize on. Wolf vs. Wolf If a Beta wolf wants to challenge an Alpha, they’ll need to risk 100 Dominance. That’s not an insignificant amount given the average yield of a Lil Lamb — what the Beta wolf receives during monthly airdrops. Not only that, but if an Alpha wolf accepts a Beta’s challenge, the Alpha wolf can do so bullishly — knowing it has a 75% chance to win. If the Alpha wolf wins the challenge (and it’s statistically likely to do so) its wallet holder will acquire 90 of the 100 Dominance that the Beta put on the table. The other 10 is burned as a deflationary and anti-abuse mechanism. For those counting, 90 Dominance is the equivalent of eating three average Scrumptious Sheep; a meaningful bounty. If the Beta wolf manages to win the challenge, it keeps its Dominance and switches metadata tags with the Alpha. This means for all future airdrops, the Beta wolf (now the Alpha) begins to acquire Scrumptious Sheep. Given that OpenSea does not update metadata immediately, we will keep a running ledger of recent battles on a public page for buyers to reference. Challenge Logo For Same Rank competitions (Alpha vs. Alpha & Beta vs. Beta), it’s all about Dominance. Both wolves will put up 100 Dominance, 10% will be burned (20) and 180 (total) will go to the winner with a 50/50 chance of either being victorious. The challenges will be made inside of The Wolf Den, where a player can select the Token ID of any wolf in the collection and propose a challenge. If that wolf logs into the Wolf Den and accepts, a winner will be determined and spoils delivered accordingly. Our plan is to make these HIGHLY visible via Discord and Twitter integration, so wolves can challenge others publicly and cheer on the results. We will also be implementing a Leaderboard showing number of challenges won by wolf and wallet. We may implement rewards for this at a later date. While all initial challenges will be random chance, we do have ideas on how to incorporate skill into them as well. It’s something we’ll continue to evaluate after the initial mechanics are live and we can generate feedback. We also recognize the need to properly incentivize Alpha wolves to accept challenges from Beta wolves and will adjust over time if necessary. The plan is to have PVP challenges rolled out by early Q2 of 2022. While we expect there to be a multitude of ways for you to spend Dominance, both digitally and physically, the most exciting (for now) will be to upgrade the visual appearance of your Hungry Wolf via our Augment System. This means you’ll be able to permanently change certain aspects of your NFT. Initially five traits of your Hungry Wolf will be augmentable via this method: Tier 1: Hat or Object— 2,000 Dominance Tier 2: Background or Tail— 1,000 Dominance Tier 3: Hands — 500 Dominance RUNTZ will also be able to upgrade their visual traits via the Augment System, but the tiers will cost 50% of the above due to RUNTZ earning Dominance at half the rate via eating and Wolfpack Competitions. Specific trait categories initially available to augment for RUNTZ will be announced shortly after public release. Normal Pirate Hat (Left) vs. Diamond Pirate Hat Augment (Right) Hungry RUNTZ Augment Example Diamond Crown Augment To upgrade all five traits on a single Hungry Wolf, you’ll need 6,500 Dominance. The goal is for this to be something to strive for and work on over time, not to happen overnight. Though of course those that own multiple Hungry Wolves will have the means to get there faster We may add additional trait categories over time. As well as additional levels of upgrades and even options for you to choose from. When you enter into The Wolf Den with enough Dominance, you’ll be able to select one of your Hungry Wolves or RUNTZ, as well as which trait upgrade you’d like to purchase. If confirmed, the mapped IPFS image and metadata of your NFT will change to reflect your newly acquired spoils. From that point forward, the NFT is sellable/tradable along with its augments. There will be a method available for you to revert back to the original NFT if you choose to do so. The traits of the NFTs will NOT change, as we do not want this system to affect rarity. However we will add a new trait to each wolf who has gone through this process called “AUGMENTS” with a number underneath it, 1–5. This will allow you to track and see via OpenSea which wolves have changed their visual appearance via the Augment System. We will also work with Rarity.Tools to ensure this trait is ignored for purposes of rarity. 1-of-1s, both standard and custom wolves transformed from Werewolf Coins, will not be eligible to use this system at launch. They are rare assets in their own right and will remain that way. We may devise ways for them to augment their appearance in the future. Our plan is to release the Augment System in Q2 2022. For more information we’d encourage you to join our Discord via https://discord.gg/HungryWolves. We will be updating this whitepaper as new information becomes available. STAY HUNGRY!"
PixaWizards,1000,478,0.09,286,"Whitepaper An introduction to the Pixa NFT ecosystem. Our whitepaper is divided into two sections: The Lore (backstory for the PixaRealm - the metaverse all Pixa NFT assets exist in) and The Project (a concise technical description of the project). For further technical details on the project, read the sections following the whitepaper. Pixa has been creating in the NFT space since February 2021, we hope you enjoy reading about what is coming up in the future! The Lore Throughout the history of the multiverse, there has always existed some manifestation of what we know as “magic”. Independent of the many forms that this cosmic glue has taken on - mana, joojoo, prana, aura, chi - there is (and, in all likelihood, always will be) a primordial substance existing at the essence of our universe. The quest to discover, understand, and harness this ancient and timeless material has always been one of the primary drivers of cosmic progress. Nevertheless, a story told the same way every time is far from what the ageless fates are in the business of doing. For them, the most entertaining outcome is always the best one. And so, it’s with a sprinkle of the fantastic, a hint of cosmic irony, and oodles of magic that the fates wove the story of an enchanted corner of the multiverse called the PixaRealm. Our adventure brings us to Jangala, a jungle world blossoming with life located in a star system inhabited by a rich assortment of flora and fauna. It’s rumored in ancient lore that there are some parts of Jangala so remote that mysterious, mythical creatures are able to remain hidden there to this very day. However, rumors of such perils were not enough to deter a committed crew of explorers from making their way onto the lush world. Over time, every world in the PixaRealm became inhabited. What remains alluring about Jangala in particular is that the world is host to a myriad of peculiar and useful herbs and resources. Moreover, the veil afforded to its inhabitants by the dense jungle canopy makes Jangala host to some of the PixaRealm’s most eccentric types. As fate would have it, the thick wilderness provides the ideal home for the clandestine lab of one of the first pioneers of magical thought in the realm: a wizard named Flynn. However, at the time of the wizard’s discoveries, things weren’t quite thought of in “magical” terms. Yet, there always seemed to be something transcendental about the allure of Jangala and its abundant wildlife. It was as if Flynn had been drawn there by some force. The one lens through which Flynn could express that mysterious, energetic allure was through a keen sense of curiosity about the local Jangalian flora. Every day brought a new excursion into some of the more remote parts of Jangala. With each new adventure came the discovery of some curious fungi, an exotic budding flower, or some glowing fruit. Flynn meticulously collected samples to bring back to his lab. The mage carried on in this way for many moons. Yet, collecting was not enough for the intrepid Flynn. After devising several instruments that he used to break down some of the dried materials, Flynn began experimenting with combinations of the unknown elements. Unbeknownst to him, he was the first in his star system to discover the ancient and cosmic tradition of alchemy. This ancient artform was the transmutation of elements into novel materials. The young wizard was constantly amazed by the reactions that elements underwent after some unique combinations: flurries of color filled the air in a rich phantasmagoria of stunning visual imagery; robust, alien scents oftentimes overcame the atmosphere of the laboratory; bursts of energetic sounds emanated from sizzling vats of fungi soup cauldrons. One day Flynn was startled to hear a knocking at his door. Who could have managed to discover his isolated bunker in this deep jungle? He quickly answered the door to meet the interloper. Much to his surprise, the young warlock found himself face-to-face with a young woman dressed in a rainbow robe and pointed hat. Her tone was friendly when she introduced herself as Juniper and explained to Flynn how she had felt something draw her to this part of the jungle. With no further explanation to give, the two were bewildered at the shared feeling that had brought them both to Jangala. Flynn, now feeling less fearful towards Juniper, proceeded to share tales about all the adventures and discoveries that he had made in the desolate paradise. At once, he noticed a glimmer come over his visitor’s eyes. Flynn knew that she would truly appreciate seeing his complete laboratory, and so he proceeded to give her a tour.  Juniper was mildly impressed by the simple yet elegant setup that she noticed the mage had managed to build for himself. She knew that if she could only manage to maintain her cover for another couple of moments that she would be able to find the source of what had brought her there. Beyond that, she knew that securing a precious valuable - PIXA - that she suspected was hidden somewhere in Flynn’s laboratory would bring her the favor of the Rainbow Order of the Luna Coven. Surely that would be enough to help her achieve the coveted Rainbow rank; she wore a mere silver sash on her pointed hat.  Flynn, still naïve to his interloper’s true intentions, was busy detailing the inner workings of his experiments to Juniper. He was surprised that she was actually so interested in peering into all of the jars full of potions and other assorted brews that he had concocted. When Juniper asked about the magical effects of the potions Flynn was surprised. Magical effects? Surely, she must be kidding. He was well aware of some of the more astounding effects of light, sound, and scent that his creations emitted upon their synthesis, but he had never deemed any of them safe enough for ingestion. Who was Juniper and how did she know about the potions?  In the time it took Flynn to muse about all those things, Juniper managed to slip a vial of a golden-colored potion into the pocket of her robe without the wizard noticing. It was foretold that rare PIXA was golden in color, although little else was known about it's appearance. She thought it was best to bring back the mysterious liquid with her to the coven as opposed to coming back empty-handed. With her objective complete, Juniper hastily came up with an excuse for why she had to go and was back on her way to Luna a few moments after saying goodbye to her new acquaintance. It wasn’t until later in the afternoon that Flynn would realize that one of his potions was missing. Could this be connected to his visitor’s claim about magical effects? Had she actually stolen the potion with the intention to drink it? And, if so, what effect did she expect to happen? Flynn knew that the only way to find answers would be to create some more and find out for himself. After a few hours he had another cauldron full of the golden brew. A bit apprehensive but also determined to get to the bottom of all of the mystery, the young wizard gulped down a goblet-full of his creation. Oddly enough, at first a lightly sweet yet tangy flavor filled his palette as a funny euphoria simultaneously settled over him. The last thing that he remembers is the unusually sudden burp that he surprised himself with at the end of another few large sips Meanwhile, the coven prepared itself for the Rainbow Order’s full moon ceremony that evening. There was an added sense of anticipation in the air as all of the attendees were looking forward to the unveiling of a new golden potion that a witch had discovered somewhere off-world. Word travelled fast among the coven members in Luna, the iridescent moon world at the furthest extremity of the PixaRealm. As such, the evening’s ceremony was in full attendance. Witches from every rank filled the atrium of an opulent, stories-high marble castle that houses each new moon’s ceremony. The ritual was always one of reverent celebration. During the new moons, the witches took advantage of the amplified magical energy in their world by partaking in some of their magical potions and studying them. Being the one who said that she had “discovered” the new potion, Juniper was given the honor of being the one to sample the potion at the exact dawn of the new moon.  And so, overcome with anticipation and an unrelenting conviction to rise in rank, Juniper swallowed an entire goblet of the golden potion and waited. Then she waited some more…Yet she didn’t really notice any effects other than her cheeks becoming delightfully warm. Anxious to know more, one of the witches from the High Council asked her to describe how she felt. Juniper felt as if she responded normally, but the gibberish that came out of her mouth was only partly discernible. Everything else was a slurred mess. It was clear that the poor, young witch was, in some way, incapacitated. Half of the coven was in bursts of laughter as the other half watched in awe as Juniper fumbled around attempting to regain her composure after stumbling over. The ceremony was ruined. The council had no choice but to send the patrons home. Yet curiosity about the evening’s events still loomed among the coven. Was this mysterious new potion a curse or something else that they didn’t understand? This was clearly not the PIXA they had been looking for that promised to advance their rank as witches. The same thoughts plagued Flynn as he struggled out of bed the next day and also wondered if he hadn’t somehow mildly enjoyed what had just happened to  What would ensue within the PixaRealm after those events is nothing short of magic. In an effort to create more of the golden brew, the coven of witches found a way to derive the recipe which had become a cult classic of sorts among their ranks. Our wizard also continued to refine his many variations of the original brew, which he called PixaBrews, and word of their legendary effects spread throughout all of the worlds of the PixaRealm. Factions and Creatures from all worlds were fascinated by this new, but objectively silly discovery. Beyond that, the alchemical experiments of both the wizards and witches would continue to flourish as a result of this uncanny series of events and a renaissance of magical thought and discovery would flourish in all of the worlds of the PixaRealm star system. Although they had originally been searching for magic, this accidental creation set off an era of a bizarre conflict between the wizards and witches: who could provide the most potent brew in the PixaRealm. Enter the PixaRealm as all of your favorite Pixa NFTs! The PixaRealm ecosystem consists of faction, companion, item, and land NFT assets on the Ethereum blockchain (erc-721 standard). There will be a total of 10 faction collections; two of which have already launched: PixaWizards (February 2021) and PixaWitches (October 2021). All the factions and their creature companions inhabit the ten worlds of the PixaRealm, the culmination of which is a complete metaverse with a playable game and robust tokenomics. The premise of the PixaRealm 3D metaverse centers around the conflict ensuing among the factions as they compete to create the best brew in all of the realm. Each faction NFT has a matching playable VX avatar which can be used to navigate the ten worlds within the metaverse game. Additionally, land within the metaverse can be owned by players through holding Land Asset NFTs. The decentralized adventure takes on a whole new creative dimension with land owners being able to choose where they live in any one of the ten various worlds within the PixaRealm, all of which are connected through magic portals. Land owners have four sizes to choose from: Basic, Deluxe, Premium, and Estate. Land isn’t just for show! PixaRealm land is rich with a truly magical resource: Elixir. Deposits of Elixir exist on all land in the PixaRealm, and can be mined to acquire the precious resource. These mines produce $EXLR which can be used to create potions that summon in-game VX Pixa assets that players can mint, cast spells, and will act as a resource to ""summon"" certain Pixa NFT assets! It's counterpart is the scarcer in-game currency token: $PIXA, which is essential for funding the mining of $ELXR. A powerful mage is sure to stockpile both! Besides tending to their parcels, land owners have some additional challenges to take into consideration. Over the ages, several factions formed bonds with different species of legendary creatures. These creatures have now been trained by competing factions to steal precious Elixir from mines! The initiated warlocks know of the proper relics to fend off those pesky beasts! It is foretold that throughout the PixaRealm there are relics of many forms that provided their holders protection from thieving creatures. Best of luck with gaming out your strategies, Wizards and Witches! Cheers! The Project Pixa NFT was founded in February 2021, and creates NFTs that exist in our metaverse called ""The PixaRealm"". Our project goal is to make the most decentralized, immutable NFT collections + metaverse that is possible on the Ethereum blockchain. Many other major projects in the NFT space are investor funded and will likely never relinquish centralized control, which is why we believe it is important to decentralize our project to ensure it will be accessible forever. This direction is in the true spirit of the crypto space: a decentralized, immutable platform free of censorship that can be accessible forever by users of the Pixa NFT ecosystem.  Our fantasy-themed NFTs depict a mystical world of wizards, wyverns, and artifacts, based around an absurd generations-long struggle to create the best brew the realm has ever tasted. There are 4 different categories these NFTs fall into: Collectible Assets Metaverse Assets Land Assets Specialty Assets Collectible assets include the classic NFTs you see in the space right now, mostly focused around providing an autogenerated profile picture for social media. These NFTs are 2D pixel art and depict one of three categories: a Faction, a Creature, or an Item. We have added some utility to the rarity aspect of two collections (upgradable PixaWitches and Creature #2) but overall these are mainly collectibles (there are even hidden traits not included in the metadata that the community gets to uncover!). However, when these NFTs are combined with Land Assets, they hold very important utility in generating our native erc20 tokens... more on that below. Read more on collectible assets here: Collectible Assets? Metaverse assets are the 3D versions of the collectible assets, but with an expanded scope. For example, instead of only 2 Factions in the collectible asset category, there will be 10 Factions total in the metaverse asset category. These assets are mainly for use as cross-compatible metaverse avatars, pets or wieldable items that can be interoperable across multiple platforms (for example, The Sandbox). Read more on metaverse assets here: Metaverse Assets? Land assets provide the opportunity for community members to own land in our upcoming metaverse, The PixaRealm (demo out now). These land NFTs are unique, as users will be able to use them to claim land where they want to in the metaverse. This opens up the possibility of decentralized city building, where like-minded users can choose to build near each other, which has not been done in a blockchain based metaverse before. These Land NFTs also produce a resource token called $ELXR, which can be boosted and even stolen based on the collectible assets you own or stake for specific purposes (see Land Assets for details). The dual-purpose Land NFTs are the gamified NFTs in the ecosystem. Specialty assets each have a specific role to play in the ecosystem, and range from voting rights (see The WizarDAO) to collecting 1/1s of the PixaRealm (see: PixaLE (Limited Editions): ), to funding a real world community hangout (see Mystic Brewing). Read more about the purpose of these unique NFTs and how they contribute to the Pixa ecosystem here: Specialty Assets. The main currency of the PixaRealm and the Pixa NFT project in general is the Pixa Token - $PIXA. This token has no set maximum supply, but has unique tokenomics based on how often the token is being transferred. The tokenomics are also tied to the Land NFTs, which include a giveaway and burn mechanic to redistribute and control the supply. This mechanic is controlled by on-chain WizarDAO voting (our community governance body), and can be increased or decreased to adjust based on supply and demand for the token. Read more about this in Utility Tokens: $PIXA and $ELXR. Community governance is controlled by The WizarDAO, where membership requires a WizarDAO Token NFT depicting a golden wizard hat (designed by emmy award winning artist Tim Riopelle). The DAO controls (to a certain degree) the tokenomics of $PIXA to ensure the long-term success of this project decades into the future. This allows for the token to be flexible and to adapt to changing supply and demand situations in the community.  A major goal of this project is to have a truly decentralized metaverse called ""The PixaRealm"". As of December 2021, we have a demo available for this metaverse, and building this out is the primary focus of 2022. The metaverse and land assets will both be usable in-world, along with both utility tokens $PIXA and $ELXR. The metaverse is built using the unity game engine and requires a stand-alone application to run. In 2023, we plan to decentralize this infrastructure as much as possible, creating a ""final version"" of PixaRealm and uploading it (build files and executable) to arweave to ensure it will be available for download forever. A major hurdle we plan to tackle is decentralizing the server structure itself. More details on the PixaRealm can be found here: The PixaRealm? One of the last goals of our project is to create a marketplace specifically for Pixa NFTs. This will be a zero fee marketplace where users can freely trade using either $PIXA or $ELXR as the currency denominations. This will be the last piece of the puzzle to ensure our ecosystem can continue functioning well into the future without reliance from centralized marketplaces.  Finally, we reach our IP ownership policy, which is very simple: NFT owners hold the IP ownership to the media and metadata of their token! We are working with our lawyers to determine the best way to achieve this in a legally effective but also straightforward manner. We do retain ownership of the Pixa brand and all logos associated with it. Continue reading onward through the following sections to understand the details of this complex ecosystem! After the Project Core, there is a section on the bonus perks that come along with being a member of the Pixa NFT ecosystem! Some perks are small, but some are huge! Cheers and happy reading!  This section outlines the core parts of the Pixa ecosytem. The ""Project Core"" are all the aspects of this project that we believe are essential to the project's future. When ensuring the project is immutable, the core parts will be the top priority. Pixa NFT collections are split into 4 categories: collectible assets, metaverse assets, land assets, and specialty assets. Brief descriptions of each category are provided below. Collectible assets are 2D pixel art NFTs. These NFTs are mainly collectibles, but can also be used with ""Land Assets"" to increase production of $ELXR (read more in ""Land Assets"" below). Certain collectibles can be upgraded as well (see: PixaWitches ""Rank"" trait). There are 3 subcategories of Collectible assets: Factions, Creatures and Items. Metaverse assets are 3D voxel models for use in metaverses such as the PixaRealm and Sandbox. These can be first person avatars, companions/mounts, and items that can be wielded. There are the same 3 subcategories of Metaverse assets: Factions, Creatures and Items.  Land assets are dual-purpose NFTs that allow you to 1) own an area of land in the PixaRealm metaverse, and 2) these NFTs have ""Elixir Mines"" built into them, which generate the $ELXR resource. Specialty assets are a mixture of other NFT collections that Pixa has created that have a specific purpose in the Pixa ecosystem. For example, the WizarDAO NFT tokens fit into this category (voting NFT). Also, 1/1s and collaborations that show aspects of the PixaRealm fit into this category. Collectible Assets These NFTs are mainly collectibles, but some can be upgraded, and others can also be used with ""Land Assets"" to increase production of $ELXR. Collectible assets are 2D generative pixel art NFTs, and they are the heart of the Pixa NFT project. They are mainly just collectibles, but have some utility built into them in terms of changing the metadata or the NFT, or generating one of our utility tokens. Read more about each subcategory below.  Factions: PixaWizards? Details: Supply: 1000, Ethereum erc721 contract? History: The PixaWizards were launched in February 2021 and were minted slowly over the course of a month. This was the second collection created by Pixa.  Utility:  Stake in Land NFTs for $ELXR generation multiplier. Details: The PixaWizards are the first faction released! These NFTs are the core of the Pixa project, and were minted in February 2021, before many other popular NFT projects. PixaWitches? Details: Supply: 2000, Ethereum erc721 contract? History: The PixaWitches were launched in October 2021. Utility:  Stake in Land NFTs for $ELXR generation multiplier. Spend $PIXA to upgrade the ""Rank"" trait of your witch! There are 5 upgradable ranks (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Crystal, Rainbow). This updates the metadata and also gives your witch a colored band on their hat! You can only upgrade, you can never downgrade. You can upgrade your witch on our app on our website: app.pixanft.com? Details: The PixaWitches are the second faction released! These are the follow-up collection to the wizards, and double the collection size (2000 vs. 1000)! Creatures: PixaWyverns? Details: Supply: 250, Ethereum erc721 contract? History: The PixaWyverns were launched in April 2021 Utility: Passively earn stolen $ELXR from Elixir Mine withdrawals from other Land NFT owners! No staking required! This is randomly determined using chainlink VRF.  Details: The PixaWyverns are the first ""creature"" collection, and are the companions of the PixaWizards! The Wyverns are a very limited collection at only 250 items, and do not have upgradable traits. TBA Details: Supply: 500, Ethereum erc721 contract History: coming soon Utility: Upgradable like the PixaWitches (details coming soon) Passively earn stolen $ELXR from Elixir Mine withdrawals from other Land NFT owners! No staking required! This is randomly determined using chainlink VRF.  Items: Relics of the PixaRealm? Supply: 10 types (time-limited mints) - Ethereum erc721 contract? History: The ""Relics of the PixaRealm"" were launched in September 2021 Utility: Defend your $ELXR mine (on your Land Asset NFT) from those pesky creatures looking to steal from your withdrawals! Reduce the % of the time your mine will be raided by staking a relic in your Land NFT! Details: Relics are from an earlier time in the PixaRealm, and have been unearthed by the factions that currently roam the worlds. These are free mints that are a bonus for early members of the Pixa community. Tomes of the PixaRealm Supply: 100,000 - Ethereum erc721 contract History: coming soon Utility: The owner can choose to use these NFTs for either: 1) Stake in a PixaRealm Land NFT for boosts to $ELXR production 2) Hold in wallet to gain abilities and spells outlines in the Tome. Details: There are 4 types of Tomes: Tome of Prosperity, Tome of Enchantment, Tome of Darkness, and Tome of Vitality.  There are also the 10 worlds of the PixaRealm the Tome can be from. Combining these aspect, you can therefore mint a ""Desertum Tome of Vitality"" or a ""Luna Tome of Darkness"" When minting, the user picks a ""Type"" and is minted a Tome from a random world (using Chainlink VRF).  These NFTs can only be minted by burning $ELXR, but the price to mint a Tome goes up over time! Metaverse Assets These NFTs are for use in supported metaverses such as The Sandbox or PixaRealm. Metaverse asset smart contracts are designed to emulate other successful and partnered metaverse-ready avatars such as VoxoDeus and CyberKongz. The similar contract structure ensures that our models will be usable in Sandbox, and most likely other metaverses that follow their standards. We will also be linking additional 3d model types to the contract that will be accessible through read functions to ensure regardless of the metaverse, these assets will be able to be integrated. Note: All metaverse assets are either free claims OR are available for exchange via $PIXA or $ELXR. These assets are not for primary sale in Ether. As always, any NFT can be resold on marketplaces such as LooksRare or OpenSea.  Factions: PixaFactions VX Details: Supply: 30,000, Ethereum erc721 contract This collection holds all the voxel Faction assets, with each Faction ""type"" (ie. wizards, witches) included in the metadata as a trait. There are 10 Faction ""Types"" History: coming soon Creatures: PixaCreatures VX Details: Supply: 15,000, Ethereum erc721 contract This collection holds all the voxel Faction assets, with each Faction ""type"" (ie. wizards, witches) included in the metadata as a trait. There will be 10 Creature ""Types"" History: coming soon Items: PixaItems VX Details: Supply: 50,000 - Ethereum erc721 contract This collection will hold all voxel Item assets. Relics will be included in this, and will be designated as a trait in the metadata. Also included in this will be the witch and wizard items (ie. pyro swords, familiars etc.). There are only 2 ways to acquire additional items: Magical Items: magical items can only be ""summoned"" by burning $ELXR Valuable Items: valuable items can only be ""bought"" by spending $PIXA History: coming soon Land Assets These are dual-purpose NFTs that allow you to own land in The PixaRealm and generate $ELXR. Owning a PixaRealm Land NFT entitles you to claiming a piece of land in the PixaRealm metaverse. They also produce our resource token, $ELXR.  Land claims in-world will occur after the land sale, before the end of 2022 (on track for Q3 2022). The relative size of each Land Claim class is detailed below 1000 x Basic Land = 100 x Deluxe Land = 10 x Premium Land = 1 x Estate Land Therefore, Estate land claim ""space"" is 1000x larger than a Basic claim in terms of space (including vertical build height). Every land claim will be cubic. There are 11,110 total Land NFTs: 10,000 Basic Land 1,000 Deluxe Land 100 Premium Land 10 Estate Land Generating $ELXR: To generate $ELXR, you first need to ""activate"" the Elixir Mine on your Land Claim NFT. Please note that Elixir Mines are not a separate NFT, they are ""embedded"" in your Land Claim NFT. Activation of the mine is completed by staking 100 $PIXA to activate the mine. Once activated, a mine is always active (even when traded to a new owner). Land claims produce different amounts of $ELXR depending on the parcel size, this is called the ""Base Production"": Basic Land = 1,000 $ELXR per year Deluxe Land = 10,000 $ELXR per year Premium Land = 100,000 $ELXR per year Estate Land = 1,000,000 $ELXR per year There is also a chance of ""Striking $PIXA"", which means you also receive the $PIXA accumulated in the Land contract. $PIXA accumulates in the contract over time due to the tokenomics of the PIXA Token (read Utility Tokens: $PIXA and $ELXR). You have a 5% chance of ""Striking $PIXA"" on every $ELXR withdrawal. Additionally, there is a 5% chance of ""Destroying $PIXA"" - meaning the $PIXA accumulated in the Land contract is instead sent to the burn address. This burn rate can be changed via an on-chain WizarDAO voting system. The $ELXR production of each can be boosted dramatically by meeting ""Production Multipliers"" as described below: ""Work the Mine"" - 10x multiplier Stake a PixaWizard or PixaWitch NFT ""Fund the Mine"" - 10x multiplier Stake 1,000 $PIXA in the mine  $ELXR will be produced by these mines until the 1 trillion $ELXR in the Land contract is exhausted.  Builder Note - in the future, the community could build a feedback loop of $ELXR to re-fund the Land smart contract, these mines may potentially produce more $ELXR in the future! If there is $ELXR in the land smart contract, the mines will produce. This is a potential area for the ""Pixa builders"" community to get involved! Withdrawing from an Elixir Mine: Each time you withdraw, you reduce base production by 20% of the original production amount. Therefore, if you withdraw 5 times, you will have exhausted your mine, and no more ELXR will be produced.  You can also benefit from the $ELXR withdrawal activities of others! You can also get your $ELXR stolen during withdrawals! Read below for how this works: ""Raid the Mine"" - Chance of getting 10% of another $ELXR miners withdrawal Own a creature ""Collectible Asset"" NFT in your wallet On any owners $ELXR withdrawal, a mine has a 10% chance of being ""raided"". The 10% $ELXR reward is randomly assigned to a creature, and sent directly to that wallet. ""Striking $PIXA"" is safe from raids (can't steal $PIXA) ""Defend the Mine"" - Reduce chance of your withdrawal being raided from 10% -> 5% ! Stake a ""Relic of the PixaRealm"" in a Land NFT On any withdrawal, your risk of being ""raided"" by a creature is reduced to 5%, instead of 10%. You also have the option of withdrawing your staked $PIXA from the Elixir Mine, however if you withdraw, you can never stake $PIXA again for the 10x ""Fund the Mine"" multiplier (even if it's traded). This is to discourage users from staking/unstaking $PIXA from their mines regularly, in order to gain the large multiplier you need to be willing to lock your $PIXA away long term.  Activation $PIXA (100 $PIXA to activate the mine) is available to withdraw by the owner of the Land NFT after 1 year from the time of activation.  Land Sale Information: The public sale land supply will be divided into 5 identical land sales. There is also a $ELXR minting bonus: the minter receives an amount of $ELXR directly to their wallet. The prices of each class of land is detailed below: Basic: 0.04 ETH (Bonus: 100 $ELXR) Deluxe: 0.2 ETH (Bonus: 1000 $ELXR) Premium: 1 ETH (Bonus: 10,000 $ELXR) Estate: 5 ETH (Bonus: 100,000 $ELXR) Note: This pricing is preliminary, and may change. There will be an ""allowlist"" (aka whitelist) for the land sales - how this will be done is TBA. Developer + Marketing supply: From the above supply, Pixa will retain a number of parcels for marketing purposes and for our own in world developments: 3 Estates, 20 Premium, 100 Deluxe, and 500 Basic 10,000,000 $ELXR Distribution of free Land NFTs to the community: A certain amount of the land will be claimable for a fixed period of time if you claimed your $PIXA rewards while the rewards system was running. The amount of land to be distributed is TBA. Distribution of the free NFTs will occur after the land sales. A ""Basic"" land NFT will be claimable for a fixed period of time if you have either a PixaWizard, PixaWitch, PixaWyvern, or Creature #4 NFT. You will receive one Basic Land for each of these collectibles you own. Distribution of the free NFTs will occur after the land sales.  Note: We are looking into a system where if you have multiple claims, you can upgrade to the next level of land (ie multiple Basics = 1 Deluxe) if you want to claim that way. Specialty Assets Specialty NFT collections that have very specific use cases. The WizarDAO Token NFT: There are 1,000 WizarDAO NFTs that depict a 3D golden wizard hat, and were designed by emmy award winning artist Tim Riopelle! Every PixaWizard has a free WizarDAO NFT to claim. You can check on our app to see if a wizard still has a claim available: app.pixanft.com . The WizarDAO NFTs are used to vote on community direction and use of DAO funds (read: The WizarDAO ) PixaLE (Limited Editions): This collection are all 1/1 hand-made NFTs that add to the lore of The PixaRealm. Both the Pixa NFT team and community artists contribute to this collection.  Pixa Lore: We will be deploying a smart contract that points to a PDF file (hosted on arweave) that holds all the base lore in the PixaRealm. This is community built and will be locked at the end of 2023 (unchangeable). This is not an NFT. Builders note: Although the lore is set in stone after the end of 2023, users in the future will be able to creatr additional lore collections through the WizarDAO Validation Token - $WVT:. This token allows for more collections to be added into the dis"

The Metaverse VIP Pass is your ticket to current and future utility and benefits that Tools of Rock will bestow its VIPs! These include access to the Sandbox and other metaverse concert venues, unique and one-of-a-kind airdrops, and presale privileges for future Tools of Rock projects, including the highly anticipated Gods of Rock avatar! Lastly, while all the Tools of Rock catalog is inspired by our rock heroes, our team of artists made painstaking efforts to not leverage any copyrighted materials, but to put their own creative interpretation on each album and trait. Therefore, we are left with incredible, unique artwork that exists ONLY in the Tools of Rock catalog and your collections! Situation Overview The Problem While the common adage is that “we are all early” in the NFT space, the truth of the matter is the market is quickly becoming saturated by low-effort projects, bad actors, anon teams, cash grabs, pump and dumps, and a gluttonous amount of animal avatar projects (among many others). We are seeing a tidal wave of new users join our NFT ranks, eager and excited to learn about this unbelievable medium we operate in, all to be washed out by one of the aforementioned culprits. They leave our amazing bubble and go back and systematically tell their friends that NFTs are a fraud and they lost money, thus creating seismic damage, and preventing industry growth, further mainstream adoption, and ultimately impacting all of us in some way, shape, or form. Additionally, and in line with the avatar projects we mentioned above, there is a distinct lack of creativity in a space that is driven by some of the most creative and progressive people in the world. We as a collective NFT sphere got stuck in a rut and innovation has stalled in many respects. The low hanging fruit of the next quick flip, 100x return, and projects that “conceive to launch in a week” have permeated our industry. There has been a resurgence in projects deviating from the norm, focusing on premium art, high quality project design, and unique utility…so there is hope we can come back from the abyss of an overly fragmented, homogenized market (I love Gutter Cats and CoolCats…but how many cats can we have? The Solution With the market becoming more discerning and holding teams and projects to much needed higher standards, there has become a clear opportunity for innovation and an expansion of the old norms. Tools of Rock believes that it is that innovator and revolutionary NFT. The team is not anonymous, the roadmap is vividly clear, and the art is far from low effort as this has been in construction now for over two months (an eternity in NFT time). The future extends far beyond the mint date and this is one of, if not the first NFT, that views itself as a business, not a project. The goal of the business is to provide long-term value for shareholders and Tools of Rock believes and operates as if each collector is a shareholder. Taking a fiduciary responsibility will impact every decision that the Tools of Rock team makes Roadie"" Map CHARITABLE FOCUS Partnered with Make-a-Wish Colorado (JJ is actively involved and passionate about helping these kiddos) and will donate 2.5% of all primary sales and 2.5% of all secondary sales (in perpetuity)! MINT TICKET Early access pre-sale window to help our rockers not get crushed by gas on mint day! Comes as a unique NFT that grants access to up to 4 Tools of Rock. Can be bought and sold. METAVERSE TOUR VIP BADGE For every 3 Tools of Rock NFT owned, collectors will be minted the Metaverse Tour VIP badge that is its own unique NFT and features a litany of benefits. Being part of this club is highly encouraged as the team continues to scale on more and more benefits to VIP members. SANDBOX CONCERT VENUE Upon sellout, Tools of Rock will acquire land to start building a legendary concert venue in the metaverse; significant discussions underway prior to launch both with senior team at Sandbox and designers. ALBUM COVERS We are obsessed with the album cover art and recognize they should be their own NFT. If you are VIP member, you can redeem the album art that’s within any of your Tools of Rock NFT! COLLECTIONS We have designed 10+ collections to be completed with unique and custom rewards. Each collection will focus on different trait sets (Fab Four collection requires all Beatles traits). These will go live at different stages and will be staggered. GODS OF ROCK AVATAR We aren’t immune to the abundance of avatar projects in the market, but we also know that Rock Stars just roll differently. No different than our Tools of Rock traits, Gods of Rock have been meticulously researched for optimal sizzle and face melting solos…they also have added benefit SANDBOX PARTNERSHIP – GODS OF ROCK 3D VOXELS You didn’t think we were building our Sandbox concert venue to collect dust did you? Hell no…we want your God of Rock avatar rocking out in the metaverse! TOOLS OF ROCK: VOL. II We all love the 60s and 70s, but Tools of Rock knows we love all eras of rock music. Vol. II will be bringing the hair, metal, and punk to the metaverse as it covers 1980 – 1999. Nirvana and Metallica to name a few… TOOLS OF ROCK: VOL. III Once we move into Vol. III, we are now focusing on today’s most popular bands and artists. This is where the opportunity for peak partnerships and on boarding into the metaverse will occur. Limited Edition album releases, record label partnerships, and massive metaverse concerts! …PLUS MUCH MORE! Collector Considerations The Company is well positioned to gain significant market, provide value to its collectors, and execute on each of its defined roadmap items, while also operating with longer term goals. Non-Anon Team Tools of Rock is led by JJ Lane; he has put himself out very publicly as the face of the Company while also maintaining one of the largest Twitter followings in the NFT community. Transparency and communication are pillars of successful companies yet the are sorely missed in the NFT space…except at Tools of Rock. Highly active, engaging, and intentionally soliciting feedback from the community is one of the hallmarks of the team. Best-In-Class Art Innovative & Lasting End Market (Music) Actionable & Tangible Roadmap Significant & Continued Utility Current & Future Strategic Partners Focused & Calculated Stabilizing Methods The team went through an exhaustive search to find the absolute best artist(s). As witnessed in our art, no detail was left unnoticed and every aspect of the art was ultra-premium. While cats and penguins may fade, music and rock and roll has lived forever. Tools of Rock is operating in the most dynamic sub-sector and has significant first mover’s advantage. The Company is and will be the market leader that late entrants will struggle to catch. Most projects announce merch, Discord upgrades, and “TBD” as part of their roadmap, Tools of Rock put it all on the table! Mint Passes, Sandbox partnership, Avatars with utility in Sandbox, live concerts, VIP NFT Badges, multiple already-defined airdrops, and much more. Metaverse Tour VIP badge provides access to Sandbox Concert Venue, ability to mint (only gas) all of your individual album covers, presale access to Gods of Rock avatar. Will be the tool for all future utility and VIPs will reap those rewards; additional concepts, but can’t guarantee, include a DAO with revenue % paid back to VIPs in form of a #ROCK token for all revenue generated in metaverse. Sandbox has agreed to partner with Tools of Rock to provide 3D voxels of everyone’s Gods of Rock avatars; additionally do unique item drops in land sales; provide ability to hang your Tools of Rock in your metaverse world. Joint venture with leading IRL music / vinyl company and allowing VIP members to print and display their album covers and vinyl. and many, many more to come including record labels and artists. VIP pass requiring 3+ Tools of Rock to be owned. 10+ unique collections (crafted from JJ’s deep experience and money-pit spending in Madden Ultimate Team) requiring floor, medium, and high-end Tools of Rock NFTs. Incentives and benefits to holding more via additional airdrops and staggered product launches. Technology Tools of Rock is built on the latest Solidity version ~0.8. Since a lot of the contracts copy paste code, they end up using older versions that results in more expensive gas. Newer versions are much more secure and efficient in terms of gas, ultimately allowing you to get more for your money! The best Solidity contracts in the industry today are of OpenZeppelin (“OZ”). All of the contracts use OZ but OZ has been changing quite a lot and came up with a lot of utilities. Tools of Rock leverages OZ's new stuff as well as the Counters library, Address library, etc. This adds to robustness of code (more secure, battle-tested and efficient) and separates us further from the pack as very few contracts are using these libraries. Tools of Rock is setting the standard with its code with its withdrawal feature, further assisting the buyer securing their prized Tool of Rock. Tools of Rock has conducted significant testing and recognize that the devil is in the details…so we pay a lot of attention to automated tests. For the basic features, we've built 208 tests (all passing). This level of detail and nuance is driven by our development team’s deep experience in the fintech industry, especially the payments space where testing is of utmost importance. While many smart contracts in the market today strip out on-chain provenance we DO NOT do that. Tools of Rock believes that provenance hashes are very important for NFTs. Our verified smart contract can be found on our website, www.toolsofrock.com, prior to launch Corporate Ownership & Structure Tools of Rock, LLC, Blockchain of Rock, LLC and their related entities have all been structured as Colorado LLCs, and the Company’s structure was prepared in consultation with and upon the advice of the Company’s legal counsel and its tax advisors. These additional entities were established for ownership, liability, and income tax reporting purposes. Meet the Band JJ, Lead Vocals – Prior to forming the Tools of Rock band in his garage, JJ has worked in private equity, investment banking, and co-founded a leading med-tech company. He’s a passionate Bored Ape Yacht Club supporter and overall degen when not building Tools of Rock. While he’s always had a love of music, he never made it past playing guitar in the worship band at church. Jagger, Band Manager – Jagger and JJ have been close friends for nearly 5 years, so when JJ needed a Band Manager, there was only one logical solution! Leveraging his tech and computer background, Jagger is perfect for managing the Band…and social channels! Jagger and his late father deeply connected over “Rock n Roll” and he now blesses our team and the Tools of Rock community with his generational knowledge. Cam, Electric Triangle – Pixel Pusher, Creator, and Tools of Rock’s one and only Electric Triangler! Cameron creatively interprets the bands vision into bodacious blockchain beauties while maintaining the band’s overall stage presence - Rock n Roll has never looked so good! Belfort, Electric Guitar – Belfort has been in NFTs since January (a 20-year veteran in NFT time). Consultant by day, Ape aficionado by night, always marketing and connecting people, our lead guitarist is here to rock your world. Treasure Seeker, Drummer – Treasure Seeker has been involved with blockchain development for banking over the last 2 years and recently been responsible for the tech of NFT projects such as Dizzy Dragons. Dev by day, degen NFT collector by night, he's passionate about setting the standard for NFT tech with Tools of Rock Matty P, Stage Tech – Web designer, animator, video producer, and all-around visual engineer, Matt is the one setting the stage for Tools of Rock. He's the marriage counselor of sorts, mediating the relationship between the gorgeous art and visual brand of TOR and the rock-solid technology that TOR runs on - and boy do they get along well."
vEmpire - The Founding Soldiers,582,135,0.169,181,"vEMPIRE DDAO A Democratic Decentralised Autonomous Organisation & The Front Line Against Centralisation Original Draft Whitepaper by Romulus & Remus. Written by Dominic Ryder romulus@v-empire.digital remus@v-empire.digital This document serves to outline the vEmpire DDAO, a new, fairer system of DAO which rewards honour and loyalty to the DDAO in more or equal measure to monetary contributions. The Empire's goal is to highlight centralisation in supposedly decentralised projects, & bring power back to the communities where their founders, contributors and whales have and will not, relinquish control. The Empire serves to invade and remind these projects that stakeholders share equal value to token owners. Moreover, decentralisations lack of regulation can, and has, shown to lead to monopolies when unchallenged by the community. This is especially prevalent where voting rights, coins, and/or NFTs are centred around a small percentage of high token wallets. The Empire's first conquest & invasion will be the metaverse & metaverse projects. Here we establish our base and begin the elimination of centralisation from the decentralised world. There are many reasons for entering the metaverse as our initial conquest; 1) The Empire is open to diplomatic solutions and so we plan to establish embassies. 2) Upon scouting of these projects, we have found them to be straying from their values and allowing centralised entities to take an unreasonable share of power from the communities they serve. 3) The monopolies and corporates in these metaverses have so much power that they are now leasing property, keeping up to 80% plus of the profits whilst leaving the users & community with a fractional percentage. 4) The gaming community in the real world has always been shoehorned into using the same large corporate gaming providers. Independent developers & creators have been pushed out and forced into wage labour for these gaming giants. The Empire cannot allow the gaming community to be forced, again, (but now in the virtual world) into the hands of these gaming giants. The vEmpire DDAO distributes value generated by a basket of pools and LP services to stakeholders. The DDAO functions as a cooperative, whereby stakeholders earn vEmpire’s token (VEMP) for providing collateral and, via a staking mechanism, receive a share of the fee revenues generated by supported DeFi services, pools, NFTs and any fees generated from the DDAOs contributions on the platform or in any metaverse. The VEMP work token effectively encapsulates the intrinsic value of the VEMP services basket. The VEMP token can be staked into xVEMP to grant pro-rata governance rights over all operation concerns of the DeFi services’ provision. Income generated for the Empire will be gifted to xVEMP holders. Staking derivatives will also be enabled via locked pools on top of the supported DeFi protocols. 2 1.1 - The VEMP Tokens, vEmpire Gamer Token 4 VEMP 4 xVEMP 4 xsVEMP 5 1.2. The Empire's Invasion of the Metaverse 5 1.3 - The DDAO - Democratised decentralized autonomous organization 6 1.4 - Token distribution and protecting our Soldiers 7 1.5 - VEMP Token Airdrop 7 2.1 The Empire compounds APY inside strategies whilst you compound outside 8 2.2- Incentivising Metaverse tokens onto the platform 8 2.3 - LAND leasing, buying & maintenance of the DDAO 9 3.1 - Metaverse limitations 10 3.2 Vegas City, Metaverse Group/Ventures & Founders who won’t let go 10 3.3 - Marketing & Development Schedule 11 Marketing Schedule & Development schedule 11 4.1 - Tokenomics & emission schedule 12 4.2 - Inflation Table 12 5.1 - The Battles & Playing Card Game 13 5.2 - The Empires Gladiators and the kings of men 14 5.3 - Fair Game 14 5.4 - Lore 15 5.5 - Trading Card Games 16 5.6 - Wearables & No Soldier Left Behind 16 Card proof of concept 17 6.0 - Disclaimer 20 3 1.1 - The VEMP Tokens - vEmpire Gamer Token VEMP Integral to the protocol is the VEMP token. This is the native token for the Empire and is the currency used to reward trading card battle winners, liquidity providers, stakers and the DDAO. At present, Metaverses only have MANA or other native tokens being used on world for content. Eventually, we would hope to be in a position to influence VEMP onto the platform as well. Upon successful launch of V2, the Land and Estates purchased will be monetized and rebuilt in the aesthetiques of the Empire. All profits will be distributed to the DDAO. The first parcels of land are likely to be; ? An Embassy & NFT art gallery for purchase of trading cards & vEmpire wearables ? A Colosseum, gladiator gambling and NFTs ? Chariot Racing Track, gambling and Charioteer NFTs ? Army Barracks & Bedsit, native Metaverse token charged per “nights stay”, VEMP drop into wallet, effectively a foreign exchange service until VEMP can be accepted onto other worlds xVEMP - Governance Token VEMP holders can stake their tokens for xVEMP, this will earn them rewards and voting rights in the DDAO, which will give them control of the Empire's invasion, conquest and expansion. As profits from battles and later, monetized land, gets gifted to the DDAO (xVEMP holders), the value of xVEMP will rise, meaning rewards are harvested upon unstaking from the DDAO. This rewards loyalty to the Empire as early stakers will benefit as illustrated by the equation below; R = Interest Rate as a decimal T = Years (1-R)^(1*T ) For examples below T = 6 months = 0.5 (1VEMP-0.3)^(1*0.5) = 0.836 xVEMP For examples below T = 1 Year = 1 (1VEMP-0.3)^(1*1) = 0.7 xVEMP 4 DDAO Launches - 1 VEMP = 1 xVEMP Day 1 Soldier stakes and receives the above as no rewards have yet been distributed The DDAO (as an example) sits at 30% APY which is gifted over the next 6 months 6 months later a new Soldier joins the Empire and stakes 1 VEMP This VEMP is worth 0.836 xVEMP as the xVEMP has had 6 months of rewards already paid at 30% APY 1 Year later (6 months on from the example directly above) at the same APY, 1 VEMP is now worth 0.7 xVEMP. This incentivises early adoption as xVEMP should only increase in value against VEMP xsVEMP - Battle Token For soldiers to train and fight battles xVEMP is allocated into pools which will effectively burn a percentage of the tokens and reward them to the battle winners. The pools will differ in percentage burns so people can take as much risk as they please. See section 5.1 for details 1.2 - The Empires invasion of the Metaverse Why the Metaverse? Most have DAOs? The Empire’s mission is to remind decentralised entities across the blockchain universe of their commitment to their users and communities. There are a few areas where Decentraland for example has strayed from this https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/security-council/ “Aside from the DAO, we think there should be a group of people tasked with preventing and handling security issues on LAND and Estate contracts. This group of people, which we’re calling the Security Advisory Board, will effectively act as guarantors of contract security, tasked with the job of providing swift response to bug reports.” The announcement above from Decentraland introducing the security council was based on responding to tech security. However the council has now evolved to overseeing all proposals & these five individuals deciding what is and isn’t; “badly intended or that could harm the ecosystem” The Empire wishes the security council return to its previous purpose. https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/community-voting/ We would like to take this opportunity to assure the security council that we have nothing but good intentions and will cause no harm. Our purpose is to give Decentraland back its namesake, and we see this as an honourable quest. 5 The Empire is also against outside centralised entities leasing their land parcels and taking anything over 50% of the profits. There should be equality & harmony amongst businesses and users in the Metaverese, without one profiteering from the other. The vEmpire DDAO will invade by continuously purchasing land in Metaverse protocols until we have a solid and overwhelming presence. By directing emissions to SAND, MANA, STARL & AXS pools initially on the platform, it will give a substantial yield which we hope & would intend, to capture the majority of the market there will be for metaverse staking as no other protocol is doing what vEmpire plans to do.. 1.3 - The DDAO - Democratised decentralized autonomous organization A standard DAOs voting power is decided by the number of governance tokens the wallet that is voting holds rather than a democratic vote. This means that founders, developers and high net worth investors have an advantage over the many in a standard DAO. The Empire's soldiers have the same rights as the Empire’s officers & generals when it comes to democracy & governance, and so all wallets holding over $1,000 will have one vote, the only reason it is not $1 is bots. Having this lower threshold can lead to bots and so all votes will be reviewed for suspicious activity and to prevent Sybil Attacks. The Empire rewards loyalty above all, loyalty comes with promotions & promotions come with rewards. As this is a DDAO and not a DAO, we reward based on time spent staked and not amount staked. Of course as above, this is open to abuse by bots & so the minimum amount of xVEMP needed to qualify for the ranks below is a monetary amount equating to $10,000. There are no ranges above this and promotions can still be earnt by smaller wallets but these will be from applications submitted and reviewed. Wearables and banners will be customised for the different levels. Any amount of xVEMP Staked - Auxiliary $10,000+ of xVEMP Staked for one year - Legion $10,000+ of xVEMP Staked for two years - Bannerman $10,000+ of xVEMP Staked for three years - Centurion $10,000+ of xVEMP Staked for five years - Officer $10,000+ of xVEMP Staked for ten years -General See section 5.6 for details on wearables & applications for promotions outside of the above criteria. 6 1.4 - Token distribution and protecting our Soldiers The founders will not sell tokens worth more in monetary value than their previous PAYE incomes earned prior to creation of the project, at any point in the first year of the project. The founders will sell no tokens at all unless the circulating supply is worth well in excess of 1 Million in the first year. The founders have also agreed they will never sell tokens worth more than their previous incomes any year after that until the projects circulating supply is worth significantly more than 10 Million. This does not include token sales for development which will be decided by the DDAO upon completion of V2 L1. The above agreement is only changed if the circulating supply of tokens hits 100M in market capitalisation where the limits are moved to percentages beginning at 1%. Developers and early contributors with tokens in excess of 5M will have 95% of their tokens locked for a minimum of five years, vesting linearly. Token holders not in excess of 5M will have their tokens locked for a minimum of 18 months, vesting linearly. 1.5 - VEMP Token airdrop The Empire has no quarrel with and loves the people and users of the Metaverse, it is the greedy large centralised estate owners we wish to battle with. The Empire wants to show the people of all worlds that we come in peace. Existing users & landowners will be able to claim wearables from www.v-empire.digital upon launch of the platform. Selected worlds will qualify for these wearables. As ever, the Empire rewards loyalty and those who claim and wear the empire's colours in respective Metaverses will qualify for the airdrop of VEMP. For LAND owners to qualify you should add the VEMP logo & colours to your land and houses to show solidarity with the project and the Empires invasion. The Empire can and will evolve through the ages with the buildings and units in the Metaverse, effectively invading from the Iron Age and releasing NFTs and features in more recent ages as the Empire expands to new horizons. If relationships develop with other projects that support our cause then these too may be included for VEMP distribution. 7 2.1 The Empire compounds APY within its strategies for consistent APY growth even with increased volume The Empires strategies are unique in that not only can the user compound APY by staking yield from one pool into another themselves, the strategies are also designed to naturally compound yield by reinvesting profits to buy more LAND. This means that the additional land monetized will grow the APY so that increased users of the strategy will not necessarily have a detrimental effect on the yield of the pools as it would in most other pools on DeFi DAOs. 2.2 - Incentivising Metaverse tokens onto the platform The Empire’s initial conquest remains the metaverse, with the first voyage destined for Decentraland, The Sandbox, Starlink & Axie infinity. The Empire plans to raise a warchest with the below strategy. This strategy below as an example, as always, rewards honour & loyalty by providing early stakers with yields in both VEMP and in this case SAND. The other strategies are the same process except AXS which provides returns in SLP & AXS for triple yield aggregation. The SAND staked is locked in the strategy for 6-12 months and the contributors to the strategy are rewarded forever for the time they remain staked. The initial yield will be purely VEMP, incentivised by the emissions schedule. This will be paid for a set number of months whilst LAND is purchased continually and monetised using the stakers SAND. Once the land is providing an income, the strategy will yield both VEMP & SAND until the full supply of VEMP is circulating. Eventually the emissions schedule will stop providing a yield to this strategy but by this time the LAND purchased will be vast & sufficiently monetized that the strategy will still remain an attractive place for soldiers to stake their SAND or other tokens as they will still be rewarded with yield in their tokens from all the Empire's territories. 8 2.3 - LAND leasing, buying & maintenance of the DDAO The DDAOs multiple and initial revenue streams are illustrated below. As well as metaverse tokens, the VEMP staked onto the platform (xVEMP) can act as collateral in order to borrow from AAVE and others to stake tokens into off platform strategies that will pay yields higher than the APY paid on the funds borrowed. The profit made will be paid back to the DDAO & xVEMP stakers. The DDAO will also decide if a percentage will be converted to Metaverse tokens to buy additional LAND for the Empire. We will also lease LAND from property and estate owners for fixed term APYs, allowing fair and equal revenue streams from both the Metaverse population, the token holders, and from the Metaverses private landlords. This land will be monetized and profits will be split, with the below example using MANA with 50% redistributed to xVEMP holders, and the other 50% being converted to MANA & used to purchase more land. 9 3.1 - Metaverse limitations Multiple projects have suffered from a similar lack of imagination by applying real world games to a virtual world. The Empire will look to expand and bring games and monetization which can only be possible in the virtual world, alongside allowing access to real world favourites if desired. The Empire has found other tokens and DAOs in this space suffer from a few limitations; ? Barriers to entry. Governance votes where in some cases users need over $100,000 just to vote. ? Rewards shared amongst DAOS. Other protocols in this space will also only allow those who partake in governance to benefit from rewards. The Empires purpose however is to serve our loyal supporters, not to take advantage and reward those who have the biggest wallets. This is why governance proposals will be set at an acceptable monetary minimum which will start at $10,000, rather than a percentage of tokens in distribution and all xVEMP owners will share in the rewards. 3.2 Vegas City, Metaverse Group/Ventures & Founders who won’t let go Metaverse Group & Decentraland have invested in Vegas City which is ok however the economy of Decentraland is changing with this and the Empire is seeing whales and centralised entities buying significant estates and leasing the land, keeping 70-80% of profits whilst the renters keep 20-30% The Flamingos — Vegas City. Land scarcity combined with corporates are pricing individual land owners out of decentraland, with multiple districts owned by the same individuals. Our DDAO will fight for change amongst the population of the Metaverse and seek to unite the land for a fairer and more prosperous future for all by implementing and advocating for limits on the amount of rental properties and rental income that can be gained from LAND leasing. The Empire's conquest is to save the population and property owners of the land from becoming a capitalist haven of advertising, centralised corporations and to prevent the commoditization of users. Who will occupy the land when there is nothing but slot machines and adverts? 10 3.3 Development Schedule (with developers on board from the start) V1 Layer 1 - Completion of basic platform with NFTs launched on Opensea & ability to connect ETH wallets onto the website. V1 Layer 2 - NFT boosts working & fully functioning trading card game launched on platform V1 Layer 3 - This can coincide with Layer 4 if development is quick enough, Launch VEMP and airdrop to land owners who connect to the platform and advertise VEMP on their land/buildings. Wearables giveaway on platform for Metaverse token holders who connect to the platform and equip their empire wearables in the Metaverse. V1 Layer 4 - Create the liquidity pools and the vEmpire DDAO. V2 Layer 1 - Set/start the emissions schedule to incentivise Metaverse token staking. The majority of emissions from the blocks will be given to the initial pools, with space for diversification to follow into other strategies or projects the empire assesses. V2 Layer 2 - LAND donations/leasing on and to the platform convert LAND to Empire aesthetics and begin the invasion of the Metaverse by using the tokens staked to buy land for vEmpire’s DDAO. 11 4.1 Tokenomics & emission schedule The Initial supply of VEMP will be 90M. In years one to three VEMP will be minted at 20 per block, reducing to 15 per block in years four to twelve, 10 per block in years thirteen to nineteen and 5 per block in years twenty and twenty one. This equates to a total supply of 810,720,000 VEMP or 810,720m VEMP X = Tokens Printed Y = Block Rewards Tokens minted per year - x=2.6208m*y 4.2 Inflation table 12 5.1 - The Battles, The Arena & The Playing Card Game The Empire is coming to invade the Metaverse, but before that, the leader of the empire is to be decided between Romulus & Remus (5.4). Whoevers side has the most successful battles will have their colours and shields led into battle. Not all will have the courage for the Arena. VEMP is staked for xVEMP. xVEMP can be staked/burnt, at a pre-agreed level e.g. a 10%, 25%, 50% which dictates the battle pool which will give the players xsVEMP. This is worth the same as xVEMP minus the percentage for the battle pool they have entered. To fight in The Arena is a great honour. To risk one's tokens for the advancement of the DDAO shows the true character of the soldiers, these brave gladiators will gain riches upon winning, but their losing counterparts' bravery will not go unnoticed by the DDAOs Emperors. People in the Arenas pools can battle others for it and win tokens equivalent to their burn plus their opponents burn, minus a platform fee, which will be distributed to the DDAO (xVEMP holders). Example of a 50% burn pool battle - 13 Discrete-time Markov Chain - xsVEMP Battle Players entering the arena (xsVEMP holders) will automatically have their ETH address entered into a weekly/monthly VEMP airdrop lottery to further incentivise battle, for every loss incurred their address will be entered again into the airdrop lottery so losers will have an increased chance of recouping some of their loss. Losers will also earn VEMPcon (contributor) points which can be swapped for additional trading cards. 5.2 - The Empires Gladiators and the kings of men The Empire understands that entering into the arena is not without risk. To those with the bravery, every month those staked into xsVEMP and residing in the arena will have a chance to partake in a gladiator fight for all the DDAOs support. The prize will come from the DDAO and will not risk the soldiers' own funds. The soldiers will be chosen by the DDAO and will likely be those amongst us with the most fearless reputations. 5.3 - Fair Game As above, losers are given a trading card in exchange for their loss of xVEMP/xsVEMP. This will make it easier for the losers to win future battles, however the card cannot and will not be worth more than the loss as this would incentivise players to lose. The trading card given for a loss will not be an NFT, this way it gives them an advantage for the future but not a financial incentive. xVEMP holders will earn a percentage of yield based on a 20% cut of xsVEMP burnt for battles between xsVEMP holders. xsVEMP holders will earn additional tokens from battles they win from opponents, but xsVEMP holders would also get xVEMP yield plus the additional yield/tokens from battles they partake in and win. However they can also lose in their fights. Trading card game & battle will be built first (V1 layer 1) then V2 will be actioned post token, which will be the preparation and invasion of the Metaverse. Depending on the method & results of the invasion, players will have the option to build houses, forts, towers or whatever they please with the potential to siege each other for rewards. vEMPIRE is split into two Rival factions, Romulus & Remus. The DDAO will be a collection of both factions together. Players ETH addresses are automatically assigned their faction based on monthly voting power and battles won, this means that for 1 month, Romulus 14 holders may have an advantage over Remus holders, and the next month it may be different. This adds token purchase incentives to maintain competitiveness and liquidity for the project, whilst making sure that one faction will not have control over voting for a long period to maintain a level playing field. Voting power is rebalanced by new entrants to the project being assigned to the faction with the lower voting power and/or active voters. Factions will have different unlockable features & NFTs as well as colour codes. 5.4 - Lore After years of quietly building military strength and governing the surrounding areas, the time has come for the Empire to expand its borders, and seek out new places to rule. The Empire has set its sights on the Metaverse, where there is the opportunity to invade the land of others and place the population under its command. Using the efficient military training honed over time, and the passion of its people, the Empire will soon encompass everything in its path. All is not as unified as it may seem however. After the peaceful reign of the former Emperor, his two sons vy for leadership of the powerful Empire. Romulus and Remus never saw eye to eye, and each brother won’t let the other get in the way of unlimited power. Romulus is a strong leader of men, who wins the hearts of his people with responsibility, and promises of power and wealth. Remus is the true son of the wolf. He is sly and conniving, and he will use underhand tactics in order to gain the advantage in battle. He may not be as popular as Romulus, but he will not be bested easily when it comes to playing the long game. Each brother comes with their own army, with unique abilities and troops at their disposal. Use different soldiers for different scenarios to overcome any advantage the opponent might think they have over you. Take the all out attack approach, and throw strong troops at your opponent to win through brute force, or use your cunning, and outplay your opponent by strategically removing their key players and increasing the number of cards in your hand. Choose a faction and back a brother to the end, seeing him to his rightful place as the new Emperor. Train your army, invest your time and resources into building an unstoppable force, and take what belongs to you.Then you will see your colours flown as far as the eye can see in the conquest of the Metaverse and beyond. 15 5.5 - Trading Card ideas/themes Each faction has a finite deck, featuring a certain number of cards in total. There are multiples of every card except the named soldiers and Heroes. When playing a game, the player will choose a “Legion” of a total of 30 cards, and their hand is randomly assigned 15 cards from their Legion. All players will start with at least one of every regular card, plus a basic version of the faction leader. Boosts are available by purchasing them as NFTs, this will increase damage/abilities by a certain percentage, as well as give strong perks to apply as an advantage in battle. Unique soldier cards can only be purchased as NFTs, as well as higher level “shiny” versions that have stronger perks and higher strength, as well as giving the player bragging rights. Players can purchase packs of a certain amount of cards which guarantees them at least one shiny or unique card. 5.6 - Wearables & No Soldier Left Behind Upon promotion through the Empire’s ranks soldiers will receive a wearable reflecting their achievement and loyalty. This standard armor can be upgraded, collected & changed at will. Armor, from any rank, will be available to purchase, however for every rank below a soldier is to the wearable/armor they would like to purchase, the premium increases by 100%. For example, a Bannerman purchases a rare item of Armor in their rank. This costs them 0.5 ETH or VEMP equivalent. A member of the Legion can also purchase this same armor, however this will cost them 1 ETH or VEMP equivalent. This stacks the higher somebody tries to buy outside of their rank. In the spirit of fair game and equality among all, as mentioned in section 1.3, the Empire is a DDAO and so democracy rules free. Monetary limitations are only enforced where bots that would do us harm could influence and corrupt our new democratic society & equal voting system. The Empire rewards loyalty above all, and loyalty will never just come from those with money, the Empire is built by the people for the people and so we will hear applications for increases in rank from any soldier who believes they have been loyal & contributed to the success of the Empire No matter whether that contribution was up to a specified monetary level or not. 16 Card Proof of Concept Romulus Troops Remus Troops Name Strength Class Ability Name Strength Class Ability Barbarians 1 Light Soldier Wild Animals: Remove 1 Strength from your opponent’s Light Soldier class for each Barbarian in play.

Bulldroids NFT Official,6000,2600,0.031,118,"Bulldroids White Paper THE MOST EPIC GAMING NFT PROJECT Bulldroids is a collection of 9,999+1 algorithmically generated NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, assembled from over 400 traits. No two of them are identical. The 9999 Bulldroids are splitted in 2 Generation: Generation 1: 6000: ON SALE Generation 2: 3999: ON SALE IN MARCH 2022 Besides being super cool, these 16 Bit Pixel Art Bulldog Droids are your key to being part of an exciting adventure in a unique Metaverse world. Owning a Bulldroid brings you $K9 and the chance to participate in the most epic pixel NFT project in the Metaverse. Chapter 1 : Do Bulldroids dream of cybernetic chip? Earth was definitely not in a good place. Everywhere, leading scientists in their field were trying to think of ways to save the planet from self-destruction. Instead of joining the noble fight to save the world, though, some of the world’s “best and brightest” scientists were holed up deep underground in a high tech laboratory having a blast experimenting to create the most absurd invention they could: bulldogs with cybernetic powers! Eventually, they succeeded and created three prototypes : one that could fart atomic gases, one that released nasty powerful burps, and one that could make the walls shake with its daytime snoring. They named them Fartoid, Burpoid and Snoroid. These 3 Original Bulldroids, developing higher intelligence from the crazed scientists’ experiments, soon understood that they were the butt of some sick joke. They also understood that revenge is a dish best served cold…in a dog bowl…preferably with some peanut butter.. So they continued to act as expected, like good little doggies, however, with the first opportunity they got, they turned against their cruel creators, and escaped. By this time, earth’s atmosphere had reached critical temperatures and the planet was starting to literally boil. So after a quick vote, the 3 OBs decided to take off and explore the cosmos. Chapter 2 : Bulldrostellar While they were traveling through space, the original three Bulldroids started feeling kind of… lonely. So let’s just say that they kept each other warm at night – and it’s always night in space. It still remains unclear how this miracle happened,but the three original bulldroids managed to create a huge litter.. Generation after generation of Bulldroids emerged on the spaceship, and it became so packed that no one could see what was coming ahead. A massive asteroid shower!… The impact with the space storm was ferocious, but as luck would have it, the storm had thrust the overpopulated ship into the atmosphere of a mysterious undiscovered planet. Chapter 3 : Planet of the Doggos Once they landed on that planet, the 3 original Bulldroids felt like they had reached the promised land. On this new world, they could thrust off the yoke of their silly conception and freely develop their species, hopefully building a peaceful and productive society. Or so they thought : the discovery of K9 changed everything. It was not just that mystical glow that emanated from it. Chapter 4 : The Snooze, the Fart and the Burpy There was something more, something mesmerizing about this rock, as if they could foresee a brighter future because of the K-9’s potential : The Burpoid instantly thought that it would make a solid building material. The Fartoid saw in it an energy that could fuel engines & motors to explore the planet. The Snoroid…well, he took a piece of it, crushed it into pieces, and smoked it, going into a deep trance while staring at the glowing K9. There was something sacred about these beautiful jewels, that should be protected from greed. Each type of bulldroid eventually realized their plans for K-9 could never harmoniously exist with the goals of the others.. Unable to settle their differences, the three bulldroid tribes split, each creating their own village and culture. But this split did not lead to peace on the new planet. Fighting for control of K-9 raged stronger than ever and did so for a hundred years. Chapter 5 : Bone New World A century later, the three original villages evolved into a hugecity, divided into 3 neighborhoods. Although the three factions fight each other mercilessly, the leaders of each tribe designated rules of combat that stopped the bulldroids from destroying this planet as humans did to earth. It was decided that all the fights would have to happen in specific combat arenas and every month the biggest K-9 earner across all the communities would become the Bulldroid King. Concept Bulldroids is a collection of 9,999 algorithmically generated NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, assembled from over 450 traits. Not two of them are identical. More than a simple collection, you will be able to play with your Bulldroids, and get K9. Generations Generation 1 is composed of a total of 9999 Bulldroids splitted in 2 generation. Generation 1 with 6000 immortal Bulldroids and Generation 2 with 3999 Bulldroids. 1 extra special Bulldroid ""The EGG"", the rarest and most expensive of all, will be offered to one of the 6000 Bulldroids holders of the generation 1 at random. Divided into 3 clans : 3333 - the Burpoids, who burp 3333 - the Fartoids, who fart 3333 - the Snoroids, who snore, even when awake They themselves come from the 3 founders Each clan has its own hierarchy : THE FOUNDERS : 0.13% (the 3 Bulldroids + 9 MECHAS + The Egg) LEGENDARY: 1.2% EPIC : 4.5% RARE : 13.5% UNCOMMON : 30% COMMON : 50.7% Characteristics Each clan also has dominant feelings: the Burpoids, who are smart the Fartoids, who are tough the Snoroids, who are lovers The Snoroids are the most spiritual, their half-asleep side means that they are always a bit between two worlds, not totally anchored in the material world, so they are more ""peaceful"" even if they shouldn't be made to feel bad either, and they hate to be pulled out of their half-somnolence. Their asset is their intuition. The Fartoids are the most adventurous, but also the most belligerent: just like the digestive tract that evacuates the excess of gas, they are always charged up, they are ""on fire"" hehe They don't bother with anything that is useless to them, they are very anchored in the concrete. Their asset is their instinct. The Snoroids are builders, engineers, constructors, they are a people who ""digest"" what they ingest (whether it is food or information) in a more tranquil way than the Fartoids. Their asset is their reason/reflection. Each Bulldroid has a ""Pawer Score"" according to its rarity. This ""Pawer Score"" will allow him to improve his chances of winning the rock paper scissors (Burp / Fart / Snore) by offering them to acquire powers that have different ""costs"" before a match. Depending on their clan, they may have access to particular powers that will not be the same. Tokenomics Bulldroids are ERC 721 Token NFT on Ethereum Blockchain. There is a total of 9999 Bulldroids splitted in 2 generations: Generation 1 with 6000 unique Bulldroids Generation 2 with 3999 unique Bulldroids Those 9999 Bulldroids are splitted in 3 factions of 3333 each + 1 special EGG and father of the third generation. As storing data on blockchain costs a lot, only most important data is stored on chain. Metadata As blockchain cannot store a lot of data, only most important data to identify Bulldroid is stored : Id, and a link to metadata. Each NFT has its own metadata, containing following : Each Bulldroid has Game Metadatas, and Physical Metadatas. GAME METADATAS Pawer Score Lazy Score Faction Rarity Level PHYSICAL METADATAS ID Name Image link Attributes : Background Skin Eyes Nose Mouth Accessories/Head Accessories/Face Accessories/Eyes Accessories/Mouth Accessories/Neck Accessories/Clothes Accessories/Various  ContractsEach Bulldroid has its own address on Etherscan. Official contract address is : 0xb0a747d220f3f793e1e16bf068f27c3aa3eb7a44 Buy & sell You can easily trade your Bulldroid on Opensea platform. Game Play Fight Bulldroids from rival gangs in merciless 1-on-1 fights inspired by the rock-paper-scissors gaming system. Your victories will be rewarded with K-9, an essential resource to evolve in the world of Bulldroids. The game will be available on mobile and desktop versions. Play to earn K9 The Bulldroids eat, live, and fight for precious K9 (pronounce “Canine”) By taking part into duels every day, the Bulldroids can earn K9 that will serve to pimp their character, receive new generation of NFT, and participate in the metaverse. Attributes Collection ID number No two Bulldroids are alike; each one is genetically unique. Your Bulldroid has a unique ID number. Gang color For each gang one specific color. Rarity Each Gene has traits, and traits have five distinct Rarity levels: Common Uncommon Rare Epic Legendary The cumulative score of these trait rarities in a given Applicant makes up the Rarity Score, which goes from 1-100. Pawer Score The ""Pawer Score"" will allow Bulldroid to improve its chances of winning at Burp / Fart / Snore by offering them powers that have different ""Pawer costs"" before a match. The Pawer Score is a genetic attribute present in each Bulldroid, ranging from 3 to 10 depending on their rarity. It allows each Bulldroid to acquire special powers that can be used to trick opponents before the fight, and it can evolve according to your own history. Lazy Score The Lazy Score is another genetic attribute present in each Bulldroids, ranging from 10 to 100 Volts, depending on rarity. Each fight done by your Bulldroid will consume its Lazy Score until it’s empty, meaning that the Bulldroid is too tired to continue.  It must then recharge its batteries by taking a nap in its kennel. The Bulldroids have a Lazy Score random number but in a range according to their category ex: 20-30 for the common, 60-70 for the Legendary. Bulldro-Shed charge After sell out, each owner of a Bulldroids will receive an unique Bulldro-Shed algorithmically generated NFT. These will be distributed randomly, so you can acquire a rare Bulldro-Shed, even if you own a common Bulldroid. These Bulldro-Sheds will allow Bulldroids to restore their Lazy Score more rapidly (from 4 hours to 16 hours, depending on the Bulldro-Shed) Monthly contests Competitions will be organized between clans but also within clans with different rankings. Each month, the winning clan will take the presidency of the planet by electing the best. Depending on which clan is ruling this month, different exactions can happen depending on their main feelings. The Wise 1 extra special Bulldroid ""The Egg"", the rarest and most expensive of all, will be offered to one of the 9999 Bulldroids holders at random The earlier you get your first Bulldroid, the more likely you may be chosen to receive The Wise. Although, being the owner of many bulldroids increase your chances. Development Roadmap Q1 2022 [x] Rarity data added to Rarity.tools & Rarity Sniper [ ] Edit, Rename your Bulldroid on the website.

PERSONAL LOBBY They are environments reserved for users. Each player will be able to have his own private room that can be customized using a 3D SET. By default each user has a private room with a standard template called personal lobby. PLANET & FILLER The planets physically group the lands where the platform metaverses come to life. Each planet is unique in terms of size, landscaping and, above all, consistency (water, lava, rock, snow). LANDS Lands are the basic virtual worlds. All lands are an unique size 4x4 unit NFT ERC-721 with different matrix and different filler on which a 3D SET is applied to create a metaverse useful for playing, exploring, experiencing live stream events. 3D SET TEMPLATE They are 3D scene templates generated through the editor by creators. It’s possible to generate templates on three default sizes SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE. Creating a template does not require purchase of any land. The creators can put his creations on sale in the marketplace or use it within his own lands. 6 METAVERSE A land with 3D Set is a METAVERSE, virtual worlds designed by The Nemesis or creators where players can explore, interact and play with other friends. The metaverses can be branded and diversified with different contents and experiences that can vary, according to the needs of the metaverses owners, such as pure and simple exploration, live stream events and gameplays designed within the metaverses. GAMEPLAY Engage your community through gamification within your brand’s metaverse. All gameplays are developed by The Nemesis and tested by professional game designers. This offers a fluid, functional and scalable gaming experience for users.

LAND 8 PLANET AND FILLER Each planet on The Nemesis has a unique and recognizable surface compared to the other planets. The surface is called FILLER and can have different textures and/or materials — water, lava, rock, snow, desert, etc. Each planet has its own land capacity min. 8,000 max 35,280 lands that changes according to the size of the planet. Each land is part of its own planet and cannot be moved and/or modified in its relative position and/or transferred to other planets. Each planet is divided into 80 sectors and who owns more lands in the same sector can give the name to the sector.

Each sector can be customized with name, icon and color. Owners who have the largest number of lands within the same sector, minimum 50% of total supply of the specific sector, will be able to decide the name of the sector and its customization. 10 LAND NFTs The lands are available only with blockchain ETH Layer 2 and payable only with The Nemesis ERC-20 crypto token. Each Land NFT is a composition of single units on a 4x4 grid unit generated randomly by an algorithm that checks the uniqueness of the generated matrix. The grid unit is a building area on which it is possible to place a 3D SET, while the empty parts of the matrix represent a filler (sea, forest, sand ...). This gives a further distinctive feature to the Lands NFTs. There will be no matrices with building units and fillers of the same category arranged in the same way; instead there may exist matrices of building units identical to other matrices but with different fillers. Once a 3D SET has been applied to an area of the land, the same area will no longer be available for the application of other 3D SETS. The user can remove the 3D SET and replace it with another or edit the 3D SETS and change the arrangement of the elements. Areas defined as fillers will have a base surface with particular and unique textures, shaders and colliders. NFTs LANDS CONFIG ?

Invite your friends into your inimitable metaverse! Create a new template: creators will be able to build new 3D SETS or Templates thanks to The Nemesis world editor. Integrate packages from The Nemesis assets library within the marketplace editor. The assets will be divided by themes and topics, which can be filtered and organized for better access and proper usability. Creators will be able to buy single assets, bundles or special packages through the game NEMS coins and use them without limits within their creations. To create a template, the creator must select the size on which this template can be applied SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE. Once the template assembly work has been completed to their liking, the creator will be able to sell the template on the marketplace by deciding the price in NEMS for other users. 13 A USER-GENERATED CONTENT ECOSYSTEM The Nemesis ecosystem consists of four integrated products that together provide a comprehensive experience for user-generated content production. METAVERSE CONTENTS EDITOR Allows the metaverse owner to quickly - without specific tech skills - edit only the contents that the creator made editable when they built the metaverse 3D SET. It is a user-friendly tool created for entry-level creators who want to easily customize their own textures, texts and links. For example, in a virtual art gallery already designed by a creator, an artist can only populate the contents related to the artworks on display. SALE OF TEMPLATES The creator of a template may sell a copy of the template and keep the original copy of their creation without limitation on subsequent sales. The creator will be able to decide the cost of the template in COINS. The buyer can in turn rework his copy of the purchased template and put it back on sale by transferring possession. In this case the initial creator will see the FEEs of the second transaction, then completely exit the scene on subsequent transactions. The new holder of the FEE, on subsequent transactions, will become the previous holder. On every sale, except for free ones, the platform retains 10% of the transaction fee. 14 3D SET EDITOR Creators without specific tech skills can build custom 3D SETs that any owner can apply to a land to publish a metaverse, thanks to the simple internal ambiences/scenes Editor. The 3D SET can be created using a rich library of over 50,000 3D items and assets in continuous development by The Nemesis. 15 GAMEPLAYS EDITOR Users can create customized content within gameplays designed by The Nemesis. This maintains a high-quality and controlled user experience for all gameplays. Creators can also integrate rewards and power-ups within the gameplay through the game cards made available by The Nemesis in the internal marketplace and through limited edition NFTs sold by The Nemesis on the most popular NFT marketplaces. INTERNAL MARKETPLACE Into The Nemesis’ internal marketplace, creators can sell their 3D SETS and the custom Gameplays they have designed. All users can buy 3D SETS and Gameplays by other creators. All users can also buy avatars, equipment, power-ups and game cards from The Nemesis or other users. All users can also sell or transfer to other users (cards trading) avatar, equipment, power-ups and game cards available in their inventory. All transactions within the internal marketplace are carried out through COINS, the in-game currency of the platform. DEEP ON LANDS Lands are blockchain-backed virtual tokens (using the ERC-721 standard for NFTs) representing physical parcels of The Nemesis’ Metaverse. They allow players to own a portion of the Metaverse and the ability to host content (ASSETS and GAMES). Each single land has the following properties: name, absolute coordinates, meta link, representation color, land matrix and filler. The Nemesis Metaverse is based on a Planet with unique features. LANDS SCARCITY Each planet has its own land capacity. The activation of a planet and consequently, the possibility to buy land on that specific planet will be distributed in seasons. The planets will be activated at the sell-out of the previous season with a TBD pause period. The Total Lands max supply, depends on the size of the planet but ranges from a minimum of 10K lands to a maximum of 35K lands per Planet. A presales phase will be created for each season and all lands they will be sold over a period of 6/12 months to create FOMO on the community. ? X% (aligned to the Companion Season) of total planet supply reserved for pre-sales on our market place for just 1,2 day. ? The remaining percentage of the lands plus the lands not redeemed in the pre-sales phase will be sold freely and at full price. 16 EXAMPLE OF SEASON 1 COMPANION MAX SUPPLY Total NFTs 8.000 LANDS MAX SUPPLY PRE SALES (2 DAYS) SALES Distributions % 100% 70% 30% Total Lands 11.520 8.000 3.520 USD Price $ 140 $ 280 Only NEMS token accepted, except the first season of the companions which will be sold through ETH, WETH PRE SALES COMPANIONS & LANDS Buy a Companion and get 50% off on one land purchase! During each Season of the Land sale, we reserve a special option for NFTs Companions owners of the same Season. If the NFT Companion owner decides to get the option during the land presales, he will be able to buy the land with 50% of discount. By purchasing the land, the discounted land pre sale option on that specific NFT is permanently removed. The Companion NFT stays alive without discounted land pre sale option. The Companion owner can sell or transfer his NFT to another user, who can check if there is an active discounted land pre sale option on that NFT before buying it. The other functions of the Companion will remain unchanged. TOKEN 18 MASS MARKET ADOPTION The Nemesis is an entertainment and gaming metaverse that brings blockchain to the masses for all users and creators to enjoy.

The Cult DAO launching a collectible DAO through the sale of NFT collection of 3D avatars. Public sale will be available on 01.13.2022, 6:00 PM UTC The membership card has never been so cool. Our Mission The mission of the Cult DAO is to build the largest collection of unique NFTs in the universe. Collective Goals The main goal of the DAO is to make profitable deals with unique NFTs and promote participation in the DAO among crypto art collectors. NFTs as a DAO Asset NFTs purchased for ETH should outperform ETH itself. Their scarcity and rarity makes them unique assets. CryptoPunks most successful collection, launched in 2017. It's a benchmark for our investments. FAQ! What is a DAO? The DAO is a decentralized, autonomous organization. Simply put: the Cult DAO owns a collection of curated art that is controlled by the holders of NFT tokens from the CulD collection. These voters can control the actions of the treasury to achieve their common goals that promote the DAO. ERC20 token $CulD holders are co-owners of the Cult DAO vault. How can I join DAO? You can participate in everything the DAO offers, and you can get a vote by buying an NFT token from the CulD collection. At launch or on the OS Marketplace. What does the DAO collect and why? The DAO buys NFTs. NFTs purchased for ETH should outperform ETH itself. Launch The Cult DAO Launch When will the Cult DAO launch? The DAO will be publicly launched on 01.13.2022 (6:00 PM UTC) and will remain open until all NFTs have been sold. To purchase, you can go to the website and mint the NFT for yourself. Proposed Structure The Cult DAO Structure We’re looking at two types of membership: Voting members Voting rights will be tokenized (ERC-721) and transferable. These members will vote on proposals, project plans, roadmap changes, etc. - Functions as the governing body of the DAO. Non-voting members General membership token holders (ERC-20) who do not own voting tokens. They are co-owners of the vault DAO We’re looking at two types of partners: Advisory Board Advisors exist to support the DAO and must actively participate in proposing initiatives. Beyond that, they have no additional rights or privileges. They can be voting members or non-voting members. Sponsors They can participate in funding the administrative and infrastructure costs associated with running a DAO (e.g., community managers, development of custom tools, overhead), with budgets to be approved by the DAO governing body, but these funds are independent of the DAO coffers that will be used to purchase NFTs. Committees In addition to management activities in which all DAO members participate, committees are created. Committees are groups of members with a budget and goals for DAO development within their competencies. We propose to form the following committees: Community Curation & Acquisition? Governance? Marketing and Sales? Community the Cult DAO Community Committee Purpose Support for the internal community: DAO itself, chat rooms and discussions, Supporting the external community: DAO media to communicate the DAO's messages to people who may be watching, listening, or interested in joining the organization.

Curating can be a discussion between artists, collectors, and members about what the DAO currently owns or what the DAO may own in the future. It is an ongoing discussion of what is relevant to the space, what may have been relevant in the past, and what may become relevant again in the future. Goals The main purpose of the Curation Committee is to select and propose current NFTs for a vote.

The wallet will be controlled by key members who will make every effort to act in accordance with decisions made by the holders. The two founders of the Cult DAO will each have one signature but will never have full control of the wallet (either alone or acting together).

## [Gaming Anxiety Big Data Analysis](https://github.com/safigueroa/Projects/tree/main/Gaming_Anxiety)
*	Analyzed 13,000 surveys from an online gaming community for signs of increased anxiety over the pandemic.
*	Utilized Big Data tools such as machine learning and ensemble modeling (Gradient Boosted Trees) run on an AWS EMR Cluster in Pyspark.
*	Identified potential issues in general anxiety, life satisfaction, and social anxiety levels in increased gaming.

## [Zoom Stock Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/safigueroa/Projects/tree/main/Time_Series)
*	Utilized Python libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) on 3 years of Zoom stock prices from Yahoo Finance.
*	Built time series forecasting models (Facebook Prophet and Holt-Winters) to predict future stock prices.
*	Achieved an accurate model (22% MAPE over a 120-day future forecast) which plays a critical role in reflecting overall stock market trends and seasonality.

## [Data Mining for Mental Health Awareness](https://github.com/safigueroa/Projects/tree/main/Data_Mining)
*	Applied preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis methods (PCA, Feature Selection) in Python on 28,000 untidy records of suicide rates among socio-economic factors across the globe.
*	Visualized data using seaborn (boxplots and heatmaps) and built a multivariate regression model.
*	Underlined the drastic consequences of poor mental health in the world with visualizations and analytics, using insights to combat this issue with better informed decisions.
